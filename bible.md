# The Winter Lodge - Bible

## STORY PREMISE

Late fall 1980. Five people are trapped in a remote Colorado ski lodge by an early blizzard while winterizing the failing property for its final closure. Owen inherited the lodge from his father, but decades of mysterious accidents and sabotage have bankrupted the family business—now it's being sold. His skeleton crew includes his ex-wife Angie (the chef), Patricia (the bookkeeper), Donnie (maintenance worker), and Mark (a documentary filmmaker). When they discover an elderly, frostbitten woman delirious in a locked room—a woman who shouldn't exist—she whispers warnings: "He's still here... never left... 1952..." That night, they realize someone else is living in the walls. It's Harold, Owen's uncle, presumed missing since 1972 after being disinherited. He's been sabotaging the lodge for decades out of revenge, living in hidden passages within the infrastructure. Now, driven mad by isolation and spite, he plans to burn the lodge down with them inside. As the blizzard rages and Harold strikes from the shadows, the group must survive both the elements and a man who knows every secret of the building better than they do. The tone is claustrophobic, creeping dread—Grady Hendrix meets The Shining—with ambiguous hints that Harold may not have been alone in those walls all these years.

## SETTING

**Primary Location: The Timberline Lodge**

The Timberline Lodge sits at 9,800 feet in the Colorado Rockies, forty miles from the nearest town via unpaved mountain road. Built in 1951 as a mid-century modern ski resort, it's a three-story timber and stone structure with sixty guest rooms, a massive lobby with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the slopes, a commercial kitchen, staff quarters, and sprawling basement mechanical systems. The architecture reflects postwar optimism: clean lines, picture windows, wood paneling now yellowed and warped. Decades of deferred maintenance show everywhere—water stains on ceilings, carpet worn to backing, radiators that clang and hiss. The lodge smells like old wood, mildew, dust, and the ghosts of a thousand fires in the lobby's river-stone fireplace.

The isolation is absolute. The access road becomes impassable with the first heavy snow. The nearest neighbor is a ranger station twelve miles away. Cell phones don't exist; the lodge has one landline that goes dead when ice takes down the lines. The crew has CB radio as backup. When the storm hits in Chapter 3, they're cut off completely—rescue won't arrive for minimum five days, likely seven.

**Hidden Infrastructure:**

What makes the lodge truly menacing is what Owen's family never knew: Harold designed extensive maintenance access during construction. Behind walls and beneath floors runs a network of crawlspaces, utility corridors, and service passages wide enough for a man to navigate. Loose panels, hidden doors behind furniture, ventilation shafts—Harold knows them all. He's been living in a nest in the attic crawlspace above the east wing, accessible through a false ceiling panel in a storage closet. From there, he can move through the entire building unseen.

**Time Period: November 1980**

Technology: Rotary phones, CB radio, no computers. Mark's documentary equipment is 16mm film camera (Bolex) and a portable cassette recorder—heavy, expensive gear. Weather forecasts come from AM radio. The crew uses kerosene heaters, Coleman lanterns when power fails, flashlights with D-batteries. Vehicles: Owen's Ford Bronco, Donnie's pickup, Angie's station wagon—all buried in snow by Chapter 4.

Weather: Early season blizzard, temperatures dropping to single digits at night. Snow accumulates three feet in first 24 hours, wind gusts to 50mph. Whiteout conditions make the hundred yards to the road impossible to navigate.

**Atmosphere:**

Vast empty spaces—hallways that go on forever, the lobby's cathedral ceiling, sixty dark rooms. Wind howls through gaps in window frames. Pipes groan. The building settles and creaks. Every sound could be Harold. The blizzard outside is white noise, disorienting. Inside, the temperature drops as heating systems fail. Characters see their breath. Darkness gathers in corners. The feeling is entombment—not in a cave, but in a decaying monument to failed dreams.

## CHARACTERS

### NAME: Owen Reeves
**AGE:** 34
**ROLE:** Leader/Protagonist
**APPEARANCE:** Tall, rangy build, perpetually tired eyes. Wears his father's old Carhartt jacket over flannel shirts. Has his father's habit of rubbing his jaw when stressed. Prematurely graying brown hair.
**BACKGROUND:** Inherited the Timberline from his father two years ago, along with catastrophic debt. Never wanted the lodge—he's a carpenter by trade—but family obligation trapped him. His marriage to Angie collapsed under the financial stress. This closure is both relief and failure; his family's legacy is dying on his watch.
**PERSONALITY:** Quiet, methodical, carries guilt like a weight. Takes responsibility seriously, sometimes to paralysis. Speaks little but listens carefully. Conflict-avoidant until forced to act, then decisive. Treats the crew with weary kindness. Has complicated grief about his father, who spent his life fighting to keep the lodge alive.
**ARC:** Begins defeated, ready to let the lodge die. When Harold's sabotage is revealed, Owen's guilt transforms to anger—his father wasn't a failure; they were sabotaged all along. He finds agency in protecting his people and confronting the uncle who destroyed his family. Ends with acceptance that some legacies deserve to end.
**SKILLS:** Knows the lodge layout (or thinks he does), carpentry skills for barricading/repairs, reads weather patterns from years of mountain living.
**RELATIONSHIPS:** Divorced from Angie but still deeply connected; their scenes carry unresolved tension and residual affection. Relies on Patricia's research to make sense of the pattern. Protective of the whole group but particularly Angie, which creates friction when she refuses to be protected.

### NAME: Patricia Nguyen
**AGE:** 28
**ROLE:** The Brain
**APPEARANCE:** Petite, Vietnamese-American, always cold (wears multiple layers). Wire-rim glasses, dark hair in practical bun. Carries a leather portfolio with the lodge's financial records everywhere.
**BACKGROUND:** Hired as bookkeeper six months ago to prepare financials for the sale. Came to Colorado from Seattle for a "simpler life" after burnout from corporate accounting. Lives in town, this is her first time staying at the lodge overnight. Methodical, detail-oriented, sees patterns in numbers.
**PERSONALITY:** Precise, logical, quietly intense. Speaks in facts and figures. Uncomfortable with emotional displays but fiercely loyal once committed. Has dry wit that surfaces under stress. Treats the mystery like an equation to solve.
**ARC:** Begins viewing the lodge as just a job, numbers on paper. As she uncovers decades of sabotage, she becomes personally invested—this is a puzzle demanding solution. Realizes her need for "simpler life" was running from engagement; she learns to fight for something.
**SKILLS:** Financial analysis, pattern recognition, meticulous record-keeping. Finds the paper trail that reveals Harold's sabotage spanning decades.
**RELATIONSHIPS:** Bonds with Owen over shared frustration with the lodge's mysteries. Has tentative friendship with Mark (both outsiders to the family drama). Clashes with Donnie's dismissive attitude toward her theories until evidence proves her right.

### NAME: Donnie Kowalski
**AGE:** 46
**ROLE:** The Skeptic
**APPEARANCE:** Stocky, barrel-chested, permanent squint from years outdoors. Graying beard, flannel shirts, work boots with steel toes. Missing tip of left pinky from an old accident. Smokes hand-rolled cigarettes.
**BACKGROUND:** Worked maintenance at Timberline for eighteen years, longer than anyone. Grew up in Colorado mining towns, knows mountains and machinery. Practical to the bone. Staying on until closure because he needs the paycheck—his wife is sick, medical bills are crushing him.
**PERSONALITY:** Blunt, impatient with what he calls "ghost story bullshit." Believes in what he can touch and fix. Grumpy exterior hides deep loyalty and competence. Gallows humor. Territorial about "his" systems and spaces in the lodge.
**ARC:** Refuses to believe Harold could be alive and living in the walls—it's structurally impossible, he'd know. Each piece of evidence (hidden passages he never found, sabotaged systems he blamed on age) is a blow to his expertise and pride. Forced to accept his eighteen years of knowledge were incomplete. Redeems himself by using mechanical skills to corner Harold.
**SKILLS:** Knows building systems (heating, electrical, plumbing), mechanical repairs, mountain survival skills, can jury-rig solutions with limited tools.
**RELATIONSHIPS:** Gruff respect for Owen (known him since Owen was a kid). Dismissive of Patricia's theories until proven wrong. Avoids Angie (uncomfortable around women, especially opinionated ones). Tolerates Mark's filming with eye-rolls and complaints.

### NAME: Mark Driscoll
**AGE:** 26
**ROLE:** The Believer
**APPEARANCE:** Lanky, shaggy blond hair, wire-frame glasses held together with tape. Wears a battered Army surplus jacket, jeans, hiking boots. Always has his Bolex camera or cassette recorder in hand.
**BACKGROUND:** Independent documentary filmmaker from Denver, doing a project on "dying Americana" (failing small businesses). Contacted Owen about filming the lodge's final days. He's earnest, educated (film school dropout), broke, living in his van between projects. Believes in capturing truth on film.
**PERSONALITY:** Curious, open-minded to the point of naïve. Asks endless questions. Sees everything as potential material. Optimistic despite circumstances. Discomfort with confrontation but brave with camera in hand—filming makes him bold. Talks to himself while recording, narrating observations.
**ARC:** Begins treating the situation as fascinating footage. When Harold becomes real danger, Mark must choose between being observer and participant. His instinct to document puts him in danger but also captures crucial evidence. Learns that some truths cost more to witness than he expected.
**SKILLS:** Filming/documentation, observant eye for details others miss, audio recording (accidentally captures Harold's movements in walls), youthful stamina.
**RELATIONSHIPS:** Outsider to the group, which gives him unique perspective. Friendly with Patricia (fellow analytical mind). Harold fixates on Mark because the camera "sees too much." Angie mothers him slightly. Owen alternates between tolerating and valuing his documentation.

### NAME: Angie Reeves
**AGE:** 32
**ROLE:** The Friction Character
**APPEARANCE:** Sturdy build, prematurely weathered face, auburn hair in a practical ponytail. Work-worn hands with burn scars from kitchen accidents. Wears chef's clogs, jeans, thermal shirts. Intense green eyes.
**BACKGROUND:** Married Owen at 22, worked as lodge chef for ten years while the business slowly died. Divorce finalized eight months ago—she needed to escape the sinking ship, but guilt gnaws at her. Staying for this final job because she needs closure and money. Grew up in restaurant kitchens (father was a cook), knows her way around industrial equipment and knives.
**PERSONALITY:** Blunt, defensive, quick to anger when feeling cornered. Covers hurt with sarcasm and sharp edges. Fiercely competent in her domain (the kitchen). Protective but expresses it through criticism ("You're not dressed warm enough, idiot"). Underlying vulnerability she hides behind aggression.
**ARC:** The Friction Character. Her unresolved feelings for Owen create tension—she makes cutting remarks about the lodge, their marriage, his choices. Resists group decisions, argues, suggests leaving before ensuring safety. Her contradictory virtue: she's selfish about emotional self-preservation but physically brave and loyal in crisis. When Harold attacks, she's the one who stands her ground and fights him with kitchen knives and boiling water. Redeems herself through action, finds moment of honesty with Owen in aftermath.
**SKILLS:** Kitchen combat (knives, boiling liquids, fire), knows food storage and industrial cooking systems, physically strong, high pain tolerance.
**RELATIONSHIPS:** Divorced from Owen but unfinished business permeates every interaction—resentment mixed with residual love. Dismissive of Patricia's theories out of ornery contrariness. Protective of Mark (maternal instinct). Clashes with Donnie over territory (kitchen vs. mechanical spaces) and both being stubborn.

## VILLAIN

**NAME:** Harold Reeves
**AGE:** 67 (in 1980; disappeared at 39 in 1972)
**APPEARANCE:** Gaunt to the point of skeletal, 5'8" but stooped, wild white hair and beard matted with grease and filth. Eyes yellowed and bloodshot, dilated pupils from years in darkness. Skin pale and papery. Missing several teeth. Wears layered, rotting clothing scavenged from lodge storage—1950s staff uniforms, guest coats, stolen items. Smells like mildew, old sweat, and kerosene. Hands gnarled but strong. Moves with uncanny silence despite fragile appearance.

**MANNERISMS:** Whispers to himself constantly, having full conversations with absent family members. Refers to himself in third person ("Harold knows... Harold built this..."). Obsessively touches walls, tracing seams and panels. Laughs at inappropriate moments—high, raspy giggle. Speech is fragmented, jumps between past and present. When lucid, speaks with eerie calm about his "rights" and "justice."

**BACKGROUND:** Harold was the visionary behind Timberline Lodge, worked with architects on the design, oversaw construction. But his brother (Owen's father) had the capital and business sense. In 1960, after a series of erratic episodes, the family had Harold declared incompetent and bought out his stake for pennies. Harold never accepted it. He began small sabotage—broken pipes, electrical fires, scaring guests with "ghostly" appearances. In 1972, after a confrontation with his brother, Harold vanished. Everyone assumed he'd wandered into the mountains and died. Instead, he retreated into the hidden passages he'd designed, living like a rat in the walls for eight years.

**PSYCHOLOGY:** Delusional disorder rooted in genuine grievance. Harold was wronged—his family did steal his creation—but isolation and obsession transformed justified anger into madness. He believes the lodge is a living entity that speaks to him, that it chose him as its "true keeper." His sabotage is both revenge and "protection"—he's saving the lodge from the unworthy. The final plan to burn it down is twisted mercy-killing: if he can't have it, it must be cleansed. Sees the crew as invaders, desecrators. His sister's arrival triggers escalation—she "betrayed" him worst of all.

**METHODS:** Decades of patient sabotage hidden as accidents: cut brake lines on supply trucks, loosened railings, started electrical fires, spoiled food shipments, left gas on overnight. As lodge emptied, he grew bolder—moved objects, left footprints, created "hauntings." Knows every hiding spot. Uses infrastructure against victims: locks doors remotely, cuts power, floods rooms, creates diversions. Plans to use propane and kerosene to start fire in multiple locations simultaneously.

**LAIR/DOMAIN:** Attic nest above east wing—accessed through false ceiling panel in storage closet. Contains sleeping pallet, kerosene heater, stolen supplies, walls covered in obsessive writing ("THE LODGE IS MINE" repeated thousands of times), photos of guests and family with red X's marked over faces. Extensive maps of passages drawn on walls. Disturbing evidence of decades of surveillance: stolen personal items, journals documenting daily activities of staff and guests.

**WEAKNESS:** Physical fragility (malnourished, aging, weakened), obsessive attachment to the lodge (won't leave it even to save himself), pride in his hidden knowledge (reveals himself through taunting), declining mental state (loses coherence under stress). The crew can outthink and outfight him once they understand his patterns and stop fearing the "ghost."

## MYSTERY MECHANICS

**The Crime:**

From 1960-1980, Timberline Lodge suffered sixty-three documented "accidents" that caused financial hemorrhaging: fires (7), equipment failures (23), guest injuries from "faulty" infrastructure (12), food poisoning incidents (5), vandalism (16). Three guests in the 1970s checked in but never checked out—assumed they wandered off in winter storms, bodies never recovered. Insurance paid out but premiums skyrocketed. The family nearly lost the lodge multiple times. Owen's father died believing he was cursed with bad luck; the stress killed him.

Harold orchestrated everything. He's been living in the crawlspaces, emerging at night to sabotage systems, scare guests, steal supplies. The three missing guests? Evidence in Harold's lair suggests he murdered them when they discovered him—but their bodies are never found (hidden in the mountain behind the lodge? In sealed-off passages?).

**Clue Structure:**

*Major Clues:*
1. **Patricia's Financial Analysis (Ch 8-9):** Pattern of incidents too consistent to be random; they align with family milestones (Harold's buyout, brother's wedding, Owen's birth, Harold's "death" anniversary).
2. **Donnie's Discovery (Ch 11-12):** Hidden passages behind walls, evidence of long-term habitation—supplies, bedding, tools—proves someone has been living there.
3. **Mark's Footage (Ch 13):** Review of B-roll captures gaunt figure in background of multiple shots over several days; same person, same clothing, watching them.
4. **Sister's Testimony (Ch 14-15):** Identifies Harold from description, reveals he contacted her months ago claiming he had proof of family betrayal, lured her to lodge.

*Red Herrings:*
1. Legend of "The Keeper" (Ch 5-6): Local folklore about a mountain spirit that protects empty places. Group initially wonders if it's supernatural.
2. Donnie's Suspicion (Ch 10): Pattern could indicate previous staff member or hostile business competitor, not family.
3. Angie's Theory (Ch 17): Maybe Harold died in the walls years ago and they're dealing with squatters using his old hideouts.

*Breakthrough Clue (Ch 20):* Mark's audio cassettes capture Harold's whispered monologues through the walls—recognizing his voice from old family films, Owen realizes his uncle is alive and has been orchestrating everything.

**The Ambiguous Element:**

In Mark's final footage during denouement (Ch 30), reviewing recordings from the crawlspace exploration, there's evidence of *two* sets of footprints in dust—Harold's larger prints and much smaller ones, child-sized, in areas Harold couldn't have made simultaneously. Audio analysis reveals two distinct breathing patterns on recordings where Harold was visible alone.

The small footprints are fresh (within days). Harold's writings reference "the small one" and "keeping IT fed." But no second person is ever found. Was Harold so insane he split his personality? Was there something else living in the walls with him? The three missing guests' personal effects are found in a section of passage Harold never accessed—who put them there?

The novel never confirms or denies. Rational explanation: Harold had dissociative disorder, made the prints himself during fugue states, moved the items while delusional. Supernatural possibility: Something else lived in the abandoned spaces of the lodge, predating Harold, tolerating or using him. Readers decide.

## TONE & VOICE

**Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic isolation with creeping dread. Think *The Shining* meets *The Thing*—trapped in close quarters with someone who might be anywhere, while the environment itself becomes hostile. The blizzard is constant white noise, disorienting. Inside the lodge, vast dark spaces contrast with huddled crew in small, lit areas. Every sound amplified by silence and fear.

**Dialogue:** Working-class, period-appropriate. Donnie's blue-collar bluntness ("That's horseshit"), Angie's sharp-edged defensiveness, Patricia's precise diction, Mark's earnest rambling, Owen's quiet authority. Profanity is casual (damn, shit, hell, occasional goddamn), not excessive. Banter under stress, arguments that feel real, gallows humor to cope.

**Pacing:** Slow-burn first act (establishing dread, discovering the mystery), accelerating through investigation as Harold's presence becomes undeniable, breakneck third act as fire and confrontation force immediate action. Balance methodical investigation scenes with sudden scares and escalations.

**Emotional Tenor:** Melancholic nostalgia (dying lodge, failed dreams, broken marriage) underlaid with mounting paranoia and primal survival fear. Not nihilistic—the group's competence and loyalty provide hope. The horror is intimate, personal: not monsters, but human madness made worse by isolation.

**Sensory Priority:** Cold (breath visible, fingers numb), darkness (flashlight beams, shadows), sound (wind, creaking, footsteps, silence), smell (must, kerosene, old wood), tactile (rough wool, ice on windows, splinters).

**Reference Points:** The Shining (isolation, madness), The Thing (paranoia, trapped group), Grady Hendrix's tone (grounded horror with dark humor), early X-Files (investigative structure, ambiguous ending).

## THEMES

**Legacy and Inheritance:** Owen inherited a poisoned legacy—his family's dream destroyed by internal betrayal. The lodge represents ambiguous inheritance: pride mixed with burden, success built on injustice. Harold's decades-long revenge is distorted mirror of Owen's obligation. What do we owe the past, and when must we let it burn?

**Isolation and Madness:** Harold's deterioration from wronged man to murderous hermit shows how isolation corrupts. The group's experience over one week in the same environment tests how quickly humans turn on each other under pressure. The lodge itself is character—empty spaces breeding paranoia.

**Justice vs. Revenge:** Harold was genuinely wronged. His grievance was real. But his response destroyed lives and became monstrous. The novel doesn't absolve the family's original sin (stealing Harold's creation) while condemning his decades of sabotage and murder. Moral ambiguity: everyone has blood on their hands.
