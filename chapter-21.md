# Chapter 21: Waiting for Dark

The afternoon stretched like taffy, each minute elastic and excruciating. They were as prepared as they could be—escape route dug, supplies packed, shed ready—but preparation didn't ease the waiting.

Outside, the sky had cleared completely. Through the gaps in the boarded windows, Owen could see brilliant blue bleeding toward orange as the sun tracked west. The storm that had trapped them was gone, leaving behind crystalline cold and three feet of snow. Beautiful and deadly.

Inside, the group stayed together in the lobby. They'd abandoned any pretense of normalcy. No one suggested eating or sleeping or doing anything except watching the shadows lengthen and waiting for Harold's move.

Angie had her knives laid out in front of her like surgical instruments—chef's knife, boning knife, paring knife. She'd honed them to razor edges. Her hands rested near them, ready.

Donnie gripped his pipe wrench, sitting with his back to the fire so he could see all the entrances at once. His eyes scanned constantly, cataloging every sound and movement.

Mark was writing. His notebook was nearly full, pages covered in dense handwriting, documenting everything that had happened since they'd arrived. His handwriting was shakier now, exhaustion and stress making his letters wobble, but he wrote with desperate focus.

"What are you writing?" Patricia asked quietly.

"Everything." Mark didn't look up. "If we don't make it out, someone needs to know what happened here. The full story. Evidence has to survive."

Patricia nodded. She understood documentation, the importance of records. She was triple-checking their evacuation supplies for the third time, mentally reviewing every item, calculating survival odds with different variables. Her analytical mind needed something to do.

Eleanor sat wrapped in blankets near the fireplace, rosary beads moving through her fingers in endless loops. Her lips formed silent prayers. Owen wondered what she was praying for—forgiveness for Harold, protection for them, mercy for everyone caught in this tragedy. Maybe all of it.

Owen sat next to Angie. They didn't speak at first, just sat close enough that their shoulders touched. The contact was grounding, human warmth in a place that felt increasingly inhuman.

"Do you remember our wedding?" Angie asked suddenly.

Owen glanced at her. "Of course."

"It was right here. In this lobby." She gestured at the space around them. "December, snow outside just like now. Fifty guests, everyone we loved. Your dad gave that speech about building something that lasts, about how love is the strongest foundation." She smiled sadly. "I thought he was talking about us. Turns out he meant the lodge."

Owen remembered. His father had been so proud, welcoming Angie into the family, talking about legacy and permanence. He'd looked at Owen with such hope, such faith that his son would carry forward the family dream. The lodge had been the backdrop for every major moment in Owen's life—his first steps, his graduation party, his father's wake. Every memory was wrapped up in these walls.

And now it would burn.

"I loved you so much that day," Angie said quietly. "I thought we'd have forever. You looked at me like I was the most important thing in the world."

"You were," Owen said.

"Until you weren't." She wasn't accusatory, just stating fact. "Until the lodge took that place. Until keeping it alive mattered more than keeping us alive."

"What happened to us?" Owen asked. He knew the answer—the lodge, the debt, the stress—but he wanted to hear her say it. Needed to hear it from her perspective.

"This place happened." Angie's voice wasn't angry, just sad. Resigned. "It consumed you the way it consumed your father. Slowly, year by year. Every conversation became about money, repairs, bookings, survival. You'd wake up in the middle of the night in a panic about quarterly taxes or the broken boiler or the guests who left bad reviews. I'd find you down here at three AM doing paperwork, trying to make the numbers work, trying to save something that was already dying."

She looked down at their joined hands. "You were drowning, Owen. And I couldn't save you because you wouldn't let go of the weight pulling you under. I tried for years. But eventually, I had to choose between watching you drown or saving myself."

"I should have chosen you," Owen said quietly. "Over the lodge. Over my father's dream. I should have chosen us. Should have sold it years ago, walked away."

"You couldn't," Angie said. "It was your father's dream. His legacy. You felt obligated to carry it, even though it was killing you. I understand that now. I was angry for so long, but I get it. You were trying to honor him."

"Yeah." Owen's throat was tight. "And I put it before you. Before us. I'm sorry, Angie. I'm so sorry."

She took his hand, lacing her fingers through his. "I never stopped loving you. I just couldn't live in the shadow of this place anymore. Watching it destroy you the way it destroyed him."

"It's dying now," Owen said. "One way or another, after tonight, the lodge is gone."

"Good." She squeezed his hand. "Maybe we can start over. If we survive this."

"Would you want that?" Owen looked at her. "Starting over?"

Angie met his eyes. "Ask me again when we're not trapped in a building waiting to burn alive. But... yeah. Maybe I would."

A small, fragile hope bloomed in Owen's chest. Not happiness—the situation was too dire for that—but possibility. The idea that something could be built from these ashes.

Across the lobby, Donnie suddenly stood. "Movement outside."

Everyone tensed. Owen was on his feet immediately, fireplace poker in hand, heart hammering. The moment they'd been dreading—was this it?

"Where?" Angie asked, knife already in her hand.

"West side. Near the tree line." Donnie was peering through a gap in the boards, wrench raised. "There—no, wait. It's just a branch. Wind-blown."

False alarm. They all exhaled shakily, but nobody sat back down. The adrenaline was still flooding Owen's system, making his hands tremble.

The tension was unbearable. Every creak of the building, every sound of settling timber, every gust of wind made them jump. They were wound so tight they might snap. Owen could feel it in the others—the way Patricia's eyes were too wide, the way Mark's leg bounced constantly, the way Angie's jaw was clenched so hard he worried she'd crack a tooth. Eleanor's prayers had become audible, whispered words in Latin or Spanish, running together in a continuous stream.

They were prey animals waiting for the predator to strike, and the waiting was its own form of torture.

Owen checked his watch. 5:47 PM.

The sun would set soon. Full darkness by 6:15, maybe 6:20. And Harold would move under cover of night.

As if responding to Owen's thoughts, the temperature inside the lodge began to drop. Rapidly. Within minutes, their breath was visible in the firelight.

"He's sabotaged the heating again," Donnie said quietly. "We're going to be freezing in here within an hour."

They added more wood to the fire, pulled on extra layers, huddled closer to the hearth. But the cold kept coming, seeping through the walls, rising from the floor. Harold was using the building's systems against them, making it uninhabitable.

5:55 PM.

Then Owen smelled it. Faint but unmistakable.

Kerosene.

"You smell that?" He looked at Donnie.

Donnie's face went grim. "Yeah. He's getting ready."

Patricia checked the windows. "We should go now. Before he lights it."

Owen was about to agree when they heard it: rapid movement through the walls. Scrambling, scuttling sounds, Harold moving vertically and horizontally through his passages with inhuman speed. He was everywhere at once, moving from ignition point to ignition point, preparing his apocalypse.

"Grab the packs," Owen ordered. "We're leaving. Now."

They moved fast. Donnie and Mark grabbed the supply bags. Patricia helped Eleanor to her feet, supporting her weight. Angie sheathed her knives, took a pack. Owen grabbed the last bag and moved toward the main entrance.

That's when Harold's voice filled the lodge.

It came from everywhere—the walls, the ceiling, the floors—his voice echoing through the passages and crawlspaces, amplified by the building's acoustics into something monstrous and ubiquitous. Laughing. Harold was laughing, high and raspy and utterly mad.

"She wants you to STAY!" The voice boomed and reverberated. "Witness the purification! JOIN US IN THE FLAMES!"

More laughter, echoing from a dozen directions at once. The sound was nightmarish—Harold had become the voice of the lodge itself, his madness merged with the building he'd built and destroyed.

"Move!" Owen shouted.

They pushed toward the door, bags in hand, Eleanor between Patricia and Donnie. The entrance was fifteen feet away. Ten feet. Five.

From the west wing came a sound like breathing in reverse—a whooshing WHOMP as accelerant ignited.

Orange light bloomed in the western corridor. In seconds, it had become a wall of flame, spreading faster than seemed possible. The lodge was old, dry timber soaked in sixty years of polish and wax. Harold had turned it into kindling.

The fire roared.

"Run," Owen said.

And they ran.
