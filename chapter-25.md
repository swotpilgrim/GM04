# Chapter 25: The Investigation

Three days after the fire, Sheriff Morrison called Owen with the first confirmation.

"Fire inspector found remains in the walk-in freezer," Morrison said. His voice was carefully neutral, the tone of someone delivering news that could be either good or terrible depending on perspective. "Badly burned, but enough skeletal structure intact for analysis."

Owen sat in his motel room, phone pressed to his ear, bracing himself. "And?"

"We pulled Harold Reeves' dental records from the 1972 competency hearing—medical files were still on record. Forensic odontologist did the comparison. It's a match. The remains are your uncle."

Owen exhaled. He hadn't realized he'd been holding his breath.

"Harold Reeves, confirmed age sixty-seven," Morrison continued. "Cause of death appears to be a combination of smoke inhalation and thermal injuries. He was alive when the fire reached that area. Coroner estimates he died attempting to open the freezer door from inside."

The lock. Angie had locked him in. He'd died trapped, just as he'd trapped Eleanor in Room 9, just as he'd trapped the Torres couple in the crawlspace decades ago. There was a terrible symmetry to it.

"I'm sorry," Morrison said, though Owen couldn't tell if he meant sorry for Owen's loss or sorry for having to deliver the information.

"Don't be," Owen said. "Harold made his choices."

"There's more. The story's getting out. Media's picking it up—local news first, but it's spreading. You should prepare yourself for attention."

Morrison wasn't wrong. By afternoon, Owen's motel phone was ringing constantly. Reporters from the Denver Post, Rocky Mountain News, even a national wire service. The story was too good to ignore: "Dead Man's Eight-Year Revenge: Lodge Owner's Uncle Lived in Walls."

Owen gave three interviews, using Mark's written account as reference and playing excerpts from the surviving audio recordings. Patricia provided copies of her financial analysis, showing the pattern of sixty-three documented incidents spanning twenty years. Donnie gave statements verifying the extensive hidden passage network and its navigability. Eleanor, recovered enough to speak from her hospital bed, confirmed Harold's letters and her abduction.

The story exploded across regional and then national news. True crime meets horror movie. Human interest with a dark edge. Media loved it.

Owen hated it. But he endured, because the truth needed to be told completely. No speculation, no folklore. Just facts.

Five days post-fire, Morrison called again.

"We found them," he said. "The three missing guests. Just like you said—sealed crawlspace behind the basement boiler room. Took us days to access it safely through all the collapse and damage."

Owen had been expecting this, but hearing it confirmed still hit hard. "All three?"

"Three sets of remains. Forensic team is working on identification, but positioning and personal effects suggest Dennis Kohr, Sarah Milliken, and Paul and Jean Torres. We're pulling dental records now for confirmation."

"Cause of death?"

Morrison's voice was grim. "Preliminary analysis suggests blunt force trauma for two of them—struck from behind, defensive wounds on hands and arms. The couple shows signs of asphyxiation—trapped in that space alive and sealed in. Scratch marks on the interior walls where they tried to claw their way out."

Owen felt sick. He'd known intellectually that Harold had murdered them, but hearing the brutal details made it real in a way the journal entries hadn't.

"Harold's journal has entries from those time periods," Owen said. "Talking about 'protecting the lodge' from people who 'saw too much.'"

"We've read them. District attorney is reviewing everything, but given Harold's dead, there won't be prosecution. Case will close as solved."

Two days later, Morrison delivered the official summary in person at the motel.

"Forensic confirmation on all three victims," he said, sitting across from Owen in the small room. Angie sat beside Owen, Patricia and Mark present as witnesses. "Dennis Kohr, age thirty-four, reported missing January 1974. Sarah Milliken, age twenty-eight, reported missing October 1975. Paul Torres, age forty-one, and Jean Torres, age thirty-nine, reported missing December 1977. All cases attributed at the time to misadventure or voluntary departure. All three were homicides committed by Harold Reeves."

Morrison laid out the timeline: Harold had been sabotaging Timberline Lodge since 1960, shortly after his brother bought out his stake. Sixty-three documented incidents ranging from minor vandalism to serious fires and guest injuries. Three murders of guests who'd discovered his existence. His "disappearance" in 1972 had been deliberate—moving permanently into the passages he'd designed, living like a ghost in his own creation. Eight years of isolation, planning, and deteriorating mental state, culminating in the attempted mass murder and arson that destroyed the lodge.

"Next of kin for the three victims have been notified," Morrison said. "After forty-plus years, most of them had assumed their loved ones were dead, but they never knew how or why. The not-knowing is its own kind of torture. This gives them closure, at least. Terrible closure, but closure."

"Have they..." Owen struggled with the words. "Have any of them reached out? Do they want to talk to me?"

"Some. Dennis Kohr's elderly parents—they're in their eighties now, living in Nebraska—they want to speak with you. They said they need to understand what happened, hear it from someone who was there. Sarah Milliken's sister has threatened a lawsuit against your estate, though I explained you're bankrupt and I don't know what legal standing she has. She's angry, needs someone to blame." Morrison paused. "The Torres children are the hardest case. They were teenagers when their parents disappeared in '77. Spent their entire adult lives thinking their parents had abandoned them, run off to start new lives somewhere. Family lore was that Paul and Jean were unhappy, that the 'anniversary trip' was really an escape. Finding out they were murdered, that they didn't choose to leave..." He shook his head. "That's rewriting forty years of understanding. They're devastated."

Owen felt the weight of it pressing down. Three families, decades of pain, all of it traced back to his uncle. His family. His bloodline.

"I'll meet with any of them who want to talk," Owen said. "I'll do whatever I can to help them understand. And I'll attend any memorial services. It's the least I can do."

Morrison nodded. "The Kohrs have already started planning. Once the remains are officially released by the coroner—probably another week—they'll hold services in Nebraska. They'd appreciate your presence."

"I'll be there."

After Morrison left, Patricia pulled out an envelope. "This came today. From the insurance company."

Owen opened it, already knowing what it would say.

The insurance investigation had determined arson as cause of loss. Policy specifically excluded coverage for intentional acts by owner or family members. Claim denied. No payout.

The lodge was a total financial loss. Owen owned forty acres of scorched mountain property and a pile of rubble. The land might sell eventually, but not for much—too much dark history, too remote, too expensive to rebuild.

"So that's it," Owen said, staring at the denial letter. "Everything my grandfather built, my father fought for, me trying to save. All of it gone. Nothing left."

"You have the truth," Angie said quietly. "Your father spent his whole life thinking he was failing, thinking he was incompetent, that he couldn't make the lodge work. Now you know—everyone knows—he was sabotaged. He wasn't a failure. He was fighting an invisible enemy for twenty years."

She was right. Owen's father had been vindicated posthumously. The mystery of why Timberline Lodge never quite succeeded, despite his father's tireless work, was solved. Jacob Reeves hadn't been a bad businessman or an unlucky man. He'd been deliberately destroyed by his own brother.

"That should feel better than it does," Owen said.

"Truth usually doesn't feel as good as we want it to," Patricia said. "But it's still better than lies."

That night, Owen sat alone in his motel room and read through the newspaper articles. The photos showed the Timberline ruins from multiple angles—blackened stone walls standing skeletal against snow. A sidebar showed Harold's 1960 photo next to artist reconstructions of what he might have looked like after eight years in the walls.

Another article profiled the three victims: Dennis Kohr, traveling salesman with a wife and two kids. Sarah Milliken, writer researching a book she'd never publish. Paul and Jean Torres, celebrating their twentieth anniversary on what should have been a romantic getaway.

All of them dead because they'd been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Because they'd seen or heard something that made Harold see them as threats.

All of them forgotten for decades, their families living with uncertainty, until fire had finally exposed the truth.

Owen folded the newspaper carefully and set it aside.

Sixty-three incidents. Three murders. Five attempted murders. One family legacy destroyed. Dozens of lives damaged.

All because of one man's inability to accept loss, to move on, to choose anything except revenge.

Harold had won his revenge. The lodge was destroyed. But he'd destroyed himself in the process, and taken so much else with him.

There was no victory in any of it.

Just ashes and grief and terrible, hollow truth.
