# Chapter 23: Kitchen Fight

**[Author's Note: This chapter rewinds to the evacuation sequence, showing what happened while the group escaped through the kitchen.]**

Angie saw him the moment they entered the kitchen.

Harold stood near the industrial stoves, hunched over, pouring kerosene from a five-gallon can onto the floor, the counters, the walls. A box of wooden matches sat on the stove within arm's reach. He was preparing to ignite the kitchen—their only escape route.

If he lit it now, the service door would be cut off. They'd be trapped.

Time slowed. Angie saw the whole situation in crystalline clarity: Owen and Donnie carrying Eleanor, Patricia and Mark following blind, everyone choking on smoke, exhausted, vulnerable. Harold ten feet away with enough accelerant to turn the kitchen into an inferno in seconds.

There was no time to warn them, no time to plan.

Angie made her choice.

"GET OUT!" she screamed. "Everyone out! NOW!"

She dropped her packs and charged Harold.

Owen turned, saw what she was doing. "Angie, no—"

"Go!" Patricia grabbed Owen's arm, physically pulling him toward the service door. "Trust her! Go!"

Donnie understood immediately. He and Owen carried Eleanor faster, pushing through the smoke. Mark and Patricia followed. They had seconds.

Angie hit Harold just as his gnarled fingers closed around the matchbox.

She tackled him low, all her weight behind it, her shoulder driving into his skeletal torso. They crashed into the industrial sink, stainless steel ringing like a bell. The matchbox flew from Harold's hand, skittering across the wet floor.

Harold shrieked—not words, just an animal sound of rage and pain.

He was lighter than she'd expected, nothing but bone and gristle under the layers of filthy clothing. Colliding with him was like hitting a bundle of sticks wrapped in rags. But when he turned on her, clawing at her face with overgrown nails black with filth, she realized her mistake.

He was incredibly strong. Stronger than any seventy-year-old man should be.

Those gnarled hands were iron. Decades of climbing through passages, supporting his weight on fingertips and toes, pulling himself through crawlspaces barely wider than his body—it had made him all wiry muscle and tendon, stripped of everything soft. His fingers found her throat and squeezed like a vice. Black spots danced in Angie's vision. She couldn't breathe. His face was inches from hers, wild white hair falling around them both, his breath rotten and hot, his yellow eyes mad with rage.

She grabbed the closest thing her hand found—a cast-iron skillet hanging from the overhead rack—and swung with everything she had left.

The impact was sickening, solid. The skillet connected with Harold's shoulder, and she felt the moment of resistance before something gave way. Bone crunching. The joint collapsing.

Harold screeched and released her, stumbling backward against the counter. She gasped for air, throat bruised, tasting blood in her mouth. But she couldn't stop to recover. Couldn't give him a chance to regroup.

But Harold recovered impossibly fast. He lunged at her again, and this time his teeth found her forearm. He bit down like a rabid dog, and pain exploded white-hot up her arm.

Angie headbutted him.

Her forehead cracked against his nose. Blood spurted—his or hers, she didn't know. Harold reeled back, dazed.

She had seconds. She pressed the advantage, driving him against the counter, trying to pin him. But he twisted like a snake, inhumanly flexible, and his hand found the knife on her belt—the chef's knife she'd been carrying.

He yanked it free and slashed wildly.

The blade cut through her jacket, her shirt, her skin. A line of fire opened along her forearm—shallow but bleeding, adding to the bite wound. Angie stumbled back, giving ground.

Harold advanced, giggling. Blood from his broken nose streamed down his face, mixing with the matted beard. His yellow eyes were wide, pupils dilated with madness and adrenaline. He looked like something from a nightmare—skeletal wraith in rotting clothes, holding a knife, backlit by the fire spreading through the kitchen doorway.

"She told me you'd fight," Harold whispered. "The lodge told me. She said you're strong. But I'm stronger. I'm part of her. She made me strong."

"You're just crazy," Angie said, backing toward the stoves. Her hand found the pot handle—the water she'd left heating earlier, forgotten in the chaos. Still hot. Maybe hot enough.

Harold lunged.

Angie grabbed the pot with both hands and threw the contents at him.

Scalding water hit Harold full in the face and chest. The scream that tore from his throat was inhuman—pure agony, wordless and primal. He dropped the knife, clawing at his face, stumbling blind.

Angie didn't think. She just moved.

She grabbed Harold by his filthy coat—layers of rotting fabric and stolen guest clothing—and used his momentum to drive him across the kitchen toward the walk-in freezer. The heavy insulated door stood open, frost crystallizing inside.

Harold tried to fight, but he was disoriented, burned, still screaming. Angie shoved with everything she had.

Harold tumbled into the freezer, crashing against the metal shelving. Frozen food rained down around him. He tried to scramble to his feet, reaching for the door.

Angie slammed it shut.

The heavy door closed with a solid thunk. She threw the external bolt lock, the mechanism sliding home with a metallic click.

For a moment, silence.

Then Harold started pounding from inside.

THUD. THUD. THUD.

"Let me out!" His voice was muffled but audible. "She's burning! She needs me! The lodge needs me!"

THUD. THUD. THUD.

The pounding grew frantic, desperate. Harold was throwing his entire body against the door, but the lock held. The freezer was designed to be openable from the inside—a safety feature—but Harold was either too panicked to find the mechanism or the scalding water had blinded him.

"Please!" Harold's voice cracked. "Please, I just wanted to save her! She spoke to me! She's real! Please!"

His screaming dissolved into wordless shrieks, animal sounds of terror and desperation.

Angie stood gasping, bleeding from her arm, her hands burned from the door's hot surface. The kitchen was filling with smoke. Fire was spreading from the dining room, licking at the doorway, consuming the accelerant Harold had spilled.

She had to go. Now.

Harold's screams followed her as she staggered to the service door and pushed out into the cold.

The group was there, twenty feet away, waiting for her. Owen broke away from them, waded through the snow to her side.

"Can you walk?" he asked, taking her weight.

"Yeah." Her voice was raw. "Yeah, I'm okay."

They moved together toward the shed, Owen supporting her, Donnie coming back to help. Behind them, the kitchen ignited with a roar.

Through the walls, muffled and distant, Harold's screams continued for another thirty seconds.

Then they stopped.

The silence was absolute.

"Is he—" Mark started.

"Dead," Angie said flatly. "He's dead."

They reached the shed and collapsed inside. Donnie got the heater going, the small flame casting weak orange light. Patricia treated Angie's wounds with the first aid kit—bite wound cleaned and bandaged, knife slash wrapped in gauze, burns on her hands and face treated with ointment, throat examined for serious damage. None of the injuries were life-threatening. All of them hurt like hell.

But the physical pain was nothing compared to what Angie felt inside.

She sat shaking, staring at her hands. Kitchen hands, scarred from ten years of prep work, burns from grabbing hot pans, cuts from rushed knife work. Worker's hands. Practical hands.

Killer's hands.

Her hands that had touched Harold, fought him, dragged him to the freezer. Her hands that had shoved him inside and locked the door. Her hands that had killed someone, leaving him to die in smoke and fire and darkness.

Even a monster. Even in self-defense. Even someone who'd murdered three people and tried to murder five more.

She'd still killed him. Heard his screams. Listened to them stop.

Owen sat beside her, pulled her into his arms carefully, mindful of her injuries. She pressed her face against his shoulder and shook with silent tears she wouldn't let become sobs. Wouldn't let become the breakdown she could feel building in her chest, threatening to overwhelm her.

"You saved us," Owen whispered against her hair. "You saved everyone. Me, Patricia, Mark, Donnie, Eleanor. We'd all be dead if you hadn't—"

"I killed him," Angie interrupted, her voice muffled against his jacket.

"You survived him. There's a difference." Owen pulled back enough to look at her. "Harold made his choices. He lived in those walls for eight years planning this. He murdered three people. He tried to murder us. You didn't kill him—you defended yourself and everyone you love. That's not murder, Angie. That's courage."

Outside, through the shed window, Timberline Lodge burned bright enough to light the entire mountain. Somewhere in that inferno, in a sealed walk-in freezer, Harold Reeves' body was burning too.

Eight years of living in the walls. Decades of revenge. Three murdered guests. A family destroyed.

All of it ending in fire, just like Harold had planned.

Just not the way he'd imagined.

Angie closed her eyes and tried not to hear his final screams echoing in her memory. Tried not to feel the impact of the door closing, the bolt sliding home, the finality of locking someone in to die.

She'd live with it. She'd have to. But the weight of it sat in her chest like a stone, heavy and permanent.

Owen held her tighter.

And outside, the fire burned on.
