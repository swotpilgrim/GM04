# Chapter 16: Harold's Escalation

The sound woke Donnie first—a rushing, gurgling roar that didn't belong. He sat up on his makeshift pallet near the fireplace, disoriented in the darkness. The fire had burned down to embers, casting barely enough light to see by.

Then he smelled it. Water. Wet stone. Mildew.

"Owen!" Donnie's voice cut through the lobby. "Owen, wake up!"

Owen jerked awake, the fireplace poker clattering from where it had rested across his lap. Around them, the others stirred. Patricia sat up, pushing her glasses into place. Mark fumbled for his flashlight. Angie was already on her feet, knife in hand.

"What is it?" Owen asked.

"Listen."

They all heard it then—the unmistakable sound of rushing water somewhere below them, steady and loud. Not a pipe leak. A flood.

"Basement," Donnie said, already moving toward his boots. "He cut the water main. If we don't shut it off, the whole heating system's going to freeze up when that water hits the pipes."

Owen was on his feet, pulling on his father's old Carhartt jacket. "How bad?"

"Bad enough." Donnie grabbed his flashlight and the pipe wrench he'd been keeping close. "Could lose heat completely. And we need heat or we're all dead in three days."

"I'm coming with you."

Donnie didn't argue. He wouldn't have gone alone anyway. Owen picked up the fireplace poker, its weight solid and reassuring in his hand, and followed Donnie toward the service stairs.

"We'll be back in ten minutes," Owen called over his shoulder. Patricia's face was pale in the firelight, Angie's set and angry. Eleanor was awake now, propped against the wall, her eyes hollow.

The stairwell was pitch black. Their flashlight beams swung wildly as they descended, boots echoing on concrete. The sound of water grew louder with every step. When Donnie opened the basement door, cold water rushed over his feet.

"Shit." He splashed through, and Owen followed.

The basement was flooding. Water covered the floor ankle-deep and rising, pouring from somewhere near the mechanical room. The heating system's generator hummed anxiously, still above the waterline but not for long. Electrical junction boxes sparked where water licked at their bases.

"Main valve's in the mechanical room," Donnie said, wading forward. "Watch yourself—could be live wires in this water."

They moved carefully, flashlights scanning. The basement stretched into darkness in every direction—a maze of storage rooms, the old coal room, mechanical spaces, and crawlspaces. Harold's domain. Owen felt it with every step, the certainty that they were being watched.

The mechanical room door stood open. Inside, water poured from a severed pipe—a clean cut, deliberately sawed through. Donnie swore and pushed through to the main shutoff valve on the far wall.

"Hold the light steady," he grunted, wrestling the valve wheel. It was old, stiff, and he had to throw his full weight against it. The wheel squealed, metal grinding on metal.

Owen kept his flashlight trained on Donnie's hands, but his eyes kept darting to the darkness behind them. The open doorway. The shadows beyond their small circle of light.

Something moved back there. He was certain of it.

"Hurry," Owen said quietly.

"I'm—going—as fast—as I—" Donnie gave one final heave. The valve wheel turned. The rushing water slowed, then stopped. The silence was immediate and total.

Too total.

"Got it," Donnie said, breathing hard. "Let's get the hell out of—"

Owen grabbed his arm. His flashlight had caught something at the far end of the basement, near the entrance to the old coal room.

A figure stood there, perfectly still.

Donnie's flashlight swung to follow Owen's. The beams converged, and Harold Reeves was illuminated in their crossing lights.

Owen's breath stopped.

His uncle was worse than he'd imagined from the fleeting glimpses and sounds. Harold was skeletal, gaunt to the point of being cadaverous. Wild white hair and beard matted with decades of filth framed a face that barely looked human anymore. His eyes caught the light and reflected it back yellow, like an animal's. He wore layers of rotting clothing—old staff uniforms, stolen coats, rags bound with twine. His hands were gnarled and filthy, nails overgrown and black.

But he stood straight. Watching them.

"Uncle Harold," Owen's voice cracked. He cleared his throat, tried again. "Uncle Harold, please. You don't have to do this. We can help you. We can get you out of here, get you to a hospital—"

Harold tilted his head, the movement disturbingly birdlike. Then he smiled, revealing broken and missing teeth.

"You look like him," Harold's voice was a raspy whisper that echoed in the flooded space. "Like my brother. The thief."

"He's dead," Owen said. "He's been dead two years. Whatever happened between you—"

Harold hissed. Literally hissed, like a feral cat. Then he scuttled backward into the darkness of the coal room on all fours, moving with impossible speed, and was gone.

Owen and Donnie stood frozen for three full seconds.

"Jesus Christ," Donnie breathed. "Jesus Christ."

They ran.

Up the stairs, water splashing from their boots, flashlights bouncing wildly. Through the service door and back into the lobby where the others waited. Owen slammed the door behind them, threw the bolt, and stood with his back against it, breathing hard.

"Well?" Angie demanded.

"We saw him," Donnie said. He set his wrench down carefully, as if his hands weren't quite working right. "We saw Harold."

"And?" Patricia asked.

"He's..." Owen struggled for words. How did you describe what they'd just seen? "He's worse than we thought. Feral. Living like an animal down there for God knows how long."

"What did he say?" Mark had his notebook out, documenting everything by reflex.

"He said I look like my father," Owen said quietly. "Called him a thief."

Nobody spoke for a long moment.

"Did you shut off the water?" Patricia asked finally, ever practical.

"Yeah," Donnie said. "But the damage is done. Heating system took on water. I can jury-rig something tomorrow, but we're going to be cold tonight."

They were already cold. Owen could see his breath in the firelight.

They added more wood to the fire, pulled all the blankets into a tight circle, and tried to settle back down. But nobody slept. They sat in the flickering orange light, listening to the building creak and settle around them, and waited for whatever came next.

It came at two in the morning.

THUD. THUD. THUD.

The pounding started in the walls around them—rhythmic, deliberate, moving in a circle. Harold was behind the walls, striking them with something heavy.

THUD. THUD. THUD.

"Make it stop," Eleanor whispered.

But it didn't stop. For three solid hours, Harold pounded on the walls surrounding the lobby. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow. Sometimes moving, sometimes stationary. Always loud enough to prevent sleep, to set teeth on edge, to fray nerves already worn raw.

Angie sat by the fire sharpening her kitchen knives, one after another, testing the edges with her thumb. She muttered to herself—Owen couldn't make out the words. Her movements were mechanical, obsessive.

Patricia hadn't slept in forty-eight hours. She sat with her financial records spread around her, calculating something over and over, checking and rechecking numbers that didn't matter anymore. Her eyes were sunken, her hands trembling.

Mark wrote in his notebook, page after page, documenting every sound and moment. Evidence, he'd said. If we don't make it out, evidence has to survive. But his handwriting grew shakier with each page.

Donnie sat with his back to the fire, pipe wrench across his knees, staring at the wall panels. Exhausted from constant repairs, from maintaining systems Harold kept sabotaging. He'd stopped talking entirely.

Owen watched them all deteriorate and felt the crushing weight of responsibility. His family. His uncle. His lodge. His fault, somehow, even though he knew logically it wasn't. These people were suffering because of the Reeves family legacy, and he was the one who'd brought them here.

The pounding finally stopped at five in the morning. The silence was almost worse.

Dawn came gray and cold. They'd burned through most of their firewood during the night. Owen went to check the barricaded entrance, make sure everything was still secure.

That's when he saw it.

Scratched into the heavy wooden door, deep gouges that went through varnish to raw wood: THE LODGE IS MINE.

"He was here," Owen said quietly. "During the night. He was right here."

The others gathered around. The letters were jagged, carved with something sharp—a nail, maybe, or a knife. Harold had done this while they'd huddled ten feet away, with only the door between them.

"Check the barricades," Donnie said, suddenly alert.

They checked every wall panel they'd nailed shut, every piece of furniture they'd stacked. Most were untouched.

But one panel, behind a chair they'd positioned near the back wall, had been pried partially open—just enough for a man to slip through—and then carefully replaced. The nails had been removed and set aside.

Harold had been inside the lobby with them during the night.

He'd watched them sleep. He could have killed any of them.

"Nowhere's safe," Mark said, voicing what they were all thinking. "If he got in once—"

"We reinforce everything," Donnie interrupted. "Double-nail every panel. Stack more furniture. We make this place a fortress."

But Owen looked at the message on the door, at the violated barricade, at his people's exhausted and frightened faces, and knew the truth.

Harold wasn't trying to get in to kill them.

He was proving he could. Wearing them down. Breaking them psychologically before he made his final move.

And it was working.

Angie met his eyes across the lobby. For once, her expression wasn't angry or defensive. It was just afraid.

"How much longer until rescue?" she asked.

Patricia checked her watch. "The storm broke yesterday. Road crews would start clearing this morning. Twenty-four hours, maybe thirty-six, before they get through."

"We're not going to make it that long," Angie said quietly.

Nobody argued with her.
