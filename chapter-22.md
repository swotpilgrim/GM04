# Chapter 22: Evacuation

The fire spread like a living thing, hungry and impossibly fast.

Harold had soaked the west wing in accelerants—decades of stockpiled kerosene, gasoline, propane. Within three minutes of ignition, the entire wing was a wall of flame, orange and white and reaching toward the ceiling. The sound was deafening: roaring, crackling, the building screaming as it died.

Smoke poured into the lobby, thick and black and choking.

"Stay low!" Donnie shouted, already dropping to a crouch. "Cover your faces!"

They'd prepared for this—wet cloths ready, escape route planned. Owen grabbed his pack with one hand, helped Eleanor with the other. Patricia was on Eleanor's other side, supporting her weight. Angie had two packs, Mark carried the largest one. Donnie led with flashlight and wrench.

They moved toward the main entrance in a tight group, bent nearly double to stay beneath the worst of the smoke. Owen's eyes burned, tears streaming down his face, blurring his vision. Even through the wet cloth, breathing was like inhaling ground glass. Each breath scraped his throat raw, tasted of chemicals and burning wood and something worse—melting synthetic materials, toxic fumes from decades of accumulated furniture and carpet.

The building groaned around them—a deep, structural sound of timber giving way, the death rattle of a wooden building. Somewhere above them, a beam collapsed with a splintering crash that made the floor shake. More crashes followed, a cascade of destruction spreading through the upper floors.

Then the explosions started.

Sealed rooms superheating, windows blowing out from pressure changes, doors bursting open as fire consumed all available oxygen and created its own weather system inside the lodge. Glass rained down in distant corridors with musical crashes. The heat was intense even through the smoke, waves of it radiating from the west wing like the mouth of a furnace. Owen's exposed skin felt tight, beginning to blister. His hair was singed, the smell of burned protein adding to the nauseating mix of odors.

They were fifteen feet from the main entrance when Donnie stopped.

"No," he said. "No, no, no."

Owen pushed forward to see. The entrance door was blocked—furniture piled against it from the outside, heavy pieces wedged together, impassable.

Harold had anticipated their escape route. He'd barricaded it while they'd been preparing inside.

"Move it!" Owen dropped his pack and joined Donnie, both of them attacking the furniture with poker and wrench. The door opened inward, which meant they had to drag everything through the narrow gap, working against leverage and geometry.

Behind them, the fire was approaching. Orange light flickered at the edge of the lobby. The smoke was getting thicker, lower, harder to breathe beneath.

Eleanor collapsed. Patricia tried to hold her, but the older woman's weight was too much. "Donnie!" Patricia called.

"Keep working!" Donnie grunted, wrenching at a heavy chair.

Mark saw it first—a gap in the smoke to their right. "The kitchen! We can go through the kitchen!"

Owen looked. The route would take them deeper into the building before they could circle back to the service exit, but it was their only option. The main entrance was going to take too long, and the fire was seconds away.

"Go!" Owen grabbed Eleanor under one arm, Donnie took the other. They hauled her toward the kitchen corridor.

Angie took the lead—she'd worked that kitchen for ten years, knew it in the dark. "This way! Stay close!"

They plunged into the smoke.

Visibility was measured in inches. Owen could barely see Angie's back ahead of him. The wet cloth over his face was already soaking through, useless. He coughed, his lungs burning. Eleanor was deadweight between him and Donnie, her feet dragging.

The heat was unbearable. Sweat poured down Owen's face, or maybe it was tears. His skin felt like it was blistering. The air itself seemed to burn.

They passed through the dining room—tables and chairs looming out of the smoke like ghosts, obstacles to navigate. Mark stumbled into a chair, went down hard, scrambled up cursing. Patricia held Mark's jacket, following blind.

Fire was everywhere now. It had cut off the direct path, spreading through the structure faster than they could move. They detoured left, through what had been the staff corridor, pressing against walls to feel their way.

"Patricia?!" Donnie's voice, panicked.

Owen turned. Patricia wasn't there. She'd been behind them seconds ago, but the smoke—

"Patricia!" Mark shouted.

"Here!" Her voice, distant, muffled. "I'm here!"

Donnie backtracked, disappeared into the smoke. Ten seconds. Fifteen. Owen's heart hammered. Then Donnie emerged, Patricia gripping his jacket, coughing violently.

They reached the kitchen.

The smoke was somehow lighter here—the industrial ventilation system, still partially functional, creating a pocket of almost-breathable air. Owen gulped it in, coughing, his throat raw.

Angie was already at the service door, throwing the bolt. "This way! Come on!"

Owen and Donnie dragged Eleanor across the kitchen floor. Behind them, the dining room ignited—a wall of flame visible through the doorway, racing toward them.

Angie threw the door open.

Cold air and snow rushed in, shocking after the inferno. Owen had never felt anything so good in his life.

They stumbled outside into the night. The temperature was brutal—below zero, probably ten or fifteen below—but after the heat of the fire it felt like mercy. Owen's sweat-soaked clothes froze almost immediately.

No time to appreciate it. They were out, but not safe.

"The shed!" Owen pointed through the darkness. Fifty yards away, barely visible in the moonlight, the equipment shed waited.

Eleanor couldn't walk. Owen and Donnie carried her between them, arms linked under her weight, wading through waist-deep snow. The drifts were heavy, dense, each step requiring them to lift their legs high and punch through the crust. Within ten steps, Owen's thighs were burning with exhaustion. The cold was shocking, a physical assault after the heat of the fire. His frozen clothes crackled with ice, chafed against his skin.

Angie and Patricia broke trail ahead, kicking through the snow, creating a path for the others to follow. But even with their efforts, the fifty yards to the shed might as well have been fifty miles. Mark brought up the rear, carrying the heaviest pack, gasping for breath in the thin mountain air.

Behind them, Timberline Lodge burned like a funeral pyre.

Owen looked back once and immediately wished he hadn't. The entire structure was engulfed, flames reaching a hundred feet into the black sky, lighting the night bright as noon. Windows exploded outward in cascades of glass, each one a small detonation. The west wing's roof collapsed inward with a sound like thunder rolling across the mountain. Stone walls stood like skeletal fingers around the inferno, blackened and cracking from the heat, but everything else—everything wooden, everything his family had built—was fire and ash.

Sixty years of history. Three generations of Reeves family dreams. His childhood, his memories, his father's life work.

All of it burning.

The heat was palpable even fifty yards away, melting the snow around them, singeing the air. Ash fell like black snow, drifting on the wind.

They reached the shed. Donnie kicked the door open. They collapsed inside, gasping, freezing, alive.

For a moment, no one moved. They just lay in the darkness, breathing, coughing, trying to process that they'd survived.

Then Donnie was moving, checking everyone. "Sound off. Anyone hurt?"

"Smoke inhalation," Patricia wheezed. "But okay."

"I'm good," Mark said, though he was shaking violently.

"Angie?" Owen looked for her in the darkness.

"I'm fine." Her voice was tight. "Hands are burned. From the door. But fine."

Eleanor wasn't conscious, but she was breathing—shallow and raspy, but breathing.

"Get the heater going," Owen said. "We need warmth or hypothermia's going to kill us before rescue arrives."

Donnie worked fast, lighting the portable kerosene heater they'd staged. Weak orange light filled the shed. They distributed blankets, wrapped themselves in every layer they had, huddled around the tiny heat source.

Owen could see his breath. His clothes were frozen solid in places. But they had shelter, warmth, supplies. They'd made it.

Through the shed's small window, the Timberline Lodge burned. It would burn all night, probably into tomorrow. A beacon visible for fifty miles, calling every fire department in three counties.

Rescue would come. They just had to survive until then.

Angie sat down next to Owen, wrapped a blanket around both of them. He put his arm around her, felt her shaking—from cold, from shock, from the adrenaline crash. He was shaking too.

"We made it," she said quietly.

"Yeah." Owen watched the flames through the window. "We did."

His family's legacy was burning to ash and foundation stones. Everything his grandfather built, his father fought for, he'd inherited and failed to save.

But the people he loved were alive.

Angie leaned into him, her head on his shoulder. Patricia was checking Eleanor's pulse, murmuring reassurances. Donnie was inventorying their supplies. Mark was writing in his notebook, documenting everything even now.

They'd survived.

That would have to be enough.
