# Chapter 28: Demolition

Spring 1981. May. Five months after the fire that destroyed Timberline Lodge.

Owen stood at the edge of the property and watched heavy machinery tear down what remained of his family's legacy.

The demolition crew had arrived at dawn—two bulldozers, an excavator, dump trucks lined up to haul away rubble. They'd spent the morning bringing down the stone walls that had somehow survived the fire, reducing them to manageable chunks. Now the excavator's claw ripped through foundation stones, pulling them free, stacking them for removal.

It was brutal, efficient, final.

Angie stood beside him, her hand in his. She'd driven up from town where she'd been staying—they'd been spending more time together over the past months, carefully rebuilding something neither of them wanted to call a relationship yet. Dating, maybe. Testing whether they could be together without the lodge's weight crushing them.

Today she'd come without being asked, knowing he'd need someone.

"How do you feel?" she asked quietly.

Owen watched a section of the east wing wall topple, crash into pieces. "Empty. Like I should feel more, but there's just... nothing."

"That's okay."

They didn't speak for a long time, just watched the destruction. The physical work of dismantling took hours. Stone by stone, timber fragment by timber fragment, the evidence of Timberline Lodge was loaded into dump trucks and hauled away. Some would go to salvage yards, some to landfill. None of it would remain on this mountain.

The land would be sold eventually. Patricia had explained it weeks ago—after all debts were paid, victim restitution settled, legal fees covered, Owen would have enough left over for a clean start. Not much, but something.

No development company would touch the property. Too much dark history. The national news coverage had made Timberline synonymous with "murder lodge," and no amount of rebranding could shake that association. It would sell as empty land, probably to someone who'd let it return to wilderness, nature reclaiming the scar.

Owen found himself thinking about his father.

Jacob Reeves had poured his entire life into Timberline Lodge—inherited it from his father, worked himself to exhaustion trying to keep it profitable, died at sixty-three from a stress-induced heart attack, believing he'd failed. Every setback, every mysterious accident, every financial blow—he'd taken them personally. Blamed himself. Thought he wasn't good enough, wasn't smart enough, wasn't working hard enough.

He'd never known the truth. Never knew his own brother was destroying him deliberately, year by year, sabotage by sabotage.

It was a terrible way to live. A terrible way to die.

But Owen chose to remember something else: his father's resilience. The way Jacob would get knocked down by another disaster and get back up the next day, stubborn and determined. The way he'd treated every guest with courtesy even when money was tightest. The way he'd taught Owen carpentry, passed down skills and values.

Jacob Reeves hadn't been a failure. He'd been a good man fighting an impossible battle he didn't know he was in.

That was the legacy Owen would carry. Not the lodge, but the man.

At noon, the demolition crew broke for lunch. The foreman approached Owen and Angie.

"Making good progress," he said. "Should have everything cleared by end of day tomorrow. You need anything before we finish up?"

"No," Owen said. "Just... make it clean. Don't leave any trace."

"Will do."

Patricia called that afternoon from Denver. She'd moved there two months ago, accepted a position at a major accounting firm, started rebuilding her career. But she checked in regularly, maintained contact. The shared trauma had created a bond none of them had expected.

"Final numbers came through," she said. "Everything's settled. After restitution payments to the three families, legal fees, demolition costs, and paying off the lodge's remaining debts, you'll net about thirty-four hundred dollars from the land sale."

Owen did the math. Sixty years of family business, three generations of work. $3,400.

"That's it?"

"That's it. But it's a clean slate. No debt. Nothing hanging over you. You can start fresh, Owen. That's worth something."

"Yeah." He supposed it was. "Thanks for everything, Patricia. For staying on this long."

"We survived together. That means something too."

Donnie had sent a postcard from his new job at a ski resort two valleys over. The message was characteristically terse: "Got work. Pays decent. You did good, kid. Take care." The postcard showed snow-covered peaks at sunset—beautiful, peaceful, nothing like the memories they shared of Timberline.

Mark's documentary had premiered at a small film festival, won a regional award, gotten picked up for limited distribution. He'd given all proceeds to Owen and the victims' families—not much, a few thousand dollars each, but the gesture mattered. The film told the story honestly, Mark had promised. No sensationalism, no exploitation. Just truth.

Eleanor had passed away in February, peacefully in her sleep at the assisted living facility. Heart failure, the doctors said. Owen suspected it was more complicated than that—guilt, grief, the weight of surviving when Harold hadn't. Her will had left her entire estate, modest but meaningful, split equally between the Kohrs, Milliken, and Torres families. Final restitution. Final apology.

Owen had attended her funeral. Small service, few mourners—most of her generation were gone. He'd said a prayer for her, forgiven her fully. She'd been a victim too, manipulated by her brother's madness.

As sunset approached on the first day of demolition, the foreman called Owen over.

"Found something in the foundation," he said. "Northeast cornerstone. Sealed cavity. Thought you might want to see before we haul it away."

Owen and Angie followed him to where the excavator had pulled apart the foundation's corner section. There, in a deliberately created hollow space, was a metal box.

The foreman pried it open.

Inside, protected from decades of weather, were photographs.

The first showed two young men in their twenties, arms around each other's shoulders, grinning at the camera. Owen recognized his father—young, hopeful, healthy. The other man was Harold, decades before madness had twisted him. They looked happy. They looked like brothers.

More photos: Harold and Jacob at a drafting table, working on blueprints together. Construction photos from 1951, both men in work clothes, covered in sawdust, building something they believed in. Celebrating—champagne bottles raised, workers gathered around.

Architectural sketches rolled carefully—Harold's distinctive hand, notations in both brothers' writing. "H.R. & J.R." labeled on every sheet.

And at the bottom, a note written in ink on yellowed paper:

"To our future—may Timberline stand forever and bring joy to all who enter. Built with love and pride. Harold Reeves & Jacob Reeves, May 1951."

Owen read it twice, his eyes blurring with tears.

Brothers. Partners. Dreamers who'd created something beautiful together. Before the betrayal, before the buyout, before everything fell apart.

This was what they'd been once. This was what they'd lost.

"They looked happy," Angie said softly, looking at the photos over his shoulder.

"They were." Owen's voice was thick. "They built something together, and they loved it. Both of them."

"What happened?"

"Money. Family. Probably my grandfather favoring one son over the other. Harold's mental health issues that no one understood in 1960. All the usual things that destroy families." Owen looked at the photos again. "But this happened too. This love, this partnership, this shared dream. The tragedy didn't erase this. It just buried it."

He tucked the photos and letter carefully back into the metal box. This wasn't trash. This was history. Evidence that Harold and Jacob hadn't always been villain and victim. They'd been brothers who'd built something beautiful together once.

Owen kept the time capsule.

The next day, the demolition finished. By sunset, the Timberline Lodge site was cleared—foundation broken up and removed, ground leveled, debris hauled away. Nothing remained except bare earth and the ghosts of memory.

Owen and Angie stood where the lobby had been. He remembered his wedding here, his parents' anniversary parties, Christmas celebrations with the fire roaring. His whole childhood played out in spaces that no longer existed.

"What now?" Angie asked.

Owen looked at the empty land, then at her. "Now we figure out what comes next. Together, if you want."

She smiled—careful, hopeful. "I want."

They walked back to Angie's car as darkness fell. The mountain was quiet except for wind through the pines. In a few months, grass would grow over the cleared ground. In a few years, saplings would take root. Nature would reclaim this place, erase even the memory of foundations.

But Owen would remember. Would carry the complicated truth: his family had created something beautiful and destroyed it through betrayal and madness. Harold and Jacob had been brothers before they were enemies, partners before they were destroyer and destroyed. Both versions were real. Both things were true. Both things mattered.

The time capsule sat on the back seat of Angie's car—proof that love existed before hate, that dreams existed before tragedy, that brotherhood existed before it shattered.

That was enough to build on.

That was a beginning worth taking.
