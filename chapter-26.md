# Chapter 26: Harold's Nest

One week after the fire, before the remaining structure was demolished, Owen returned to Timberline Lodge with Patricia, Donnie, and Fire Inspector Carl Rodriguez. They came to document Harold's lair for the official record—photographs, measurements, evidence collection for the closed case.

The ruins were haunting in daylight. Most of the lodge was ash and collapsed timber, scattered across the foundation like the skeleton of some massive creature. The stone walls still stood—blackened by smoke, cracked from heat, structurally unsound but refusing to fall completely. Empty window frames stared out like eye sockets.

"Watch your step," Rodriguez warned as they picked their way through the debris. "Whole thing could come down any moment."

They accessed the attic crawlspace through what remained of the east wing, climbing carefully through collapsed floors and charred beams. The space that had been Harold's primary nest had survived, protected by the stone chimney stack it wrapped around. Fire had touched it—scorch marks on the wood, smoke damage throughout—but the core was intact enough to document.

Owen stood at the entrance and stared.

The walls were covered floor-to-ceiling in Harold's handwriting. THE LODGE IS MINE repeated thousands of times in obsessive spirals, covering every available surface. Layer upon layer, written over years. In some places, the fire had peeled away the outer layers of wood, revealing older writing beneath—the same phrase in slightly different handwriting, showing Harold's deterioration over time. Early script was precise, controlled. Later script was frantic, overlapping, barely legible.

Rodriguez photographed everything methodically, his camera flash illuminating the madness documented on those walls.

"Jesus," Donnie muttered. "This is what eight years alone does to you."

The shrine was still partially intact. Photographs pinned to the wall with nails—Harold's family, faces scratched out viciously. Owen's father as a young man, eyes gouged through. Owen himself at various ages, watched and documented from childhood. Eleanor with TRAITOR written across her face in dried blood or paint.

Patricia stood before the photos, her analytical mind trying to process the obsession. "He watched you your whole life," she said to Owen. "From the time you were four years old. Documenting, observing, hating."

"Yeah." Owen couldn't look at those photos. The violation of it was too much.

They found Harold's sleeping pallet—layers of stolen linens, decades of accumulated fabric now half-burned. The kerosene heater that had been his warmth and his weapon. Food caches in careful rows, tins from the 1960s mixed with modern supplies.

And Harold's journals.

Patricia found them in a fireproof metal box tucked behind the chimney stones—three leather-bound books, their covers worn from handling, pages yellowed but intact. The box had protected them from the fire that had consumed everything else. She opened the earliest one, dated 1972, and began reading aloud:

"November 3, 1972. They think I'm dead. Jacob thinks I wandered into the mountains and froze during our confrontation. Good. Let them think it. I'm still here. I'll always be here. She needs me. The lodge needs its true keeper. I built her. Every passage, every room, every secret. She's mine, and I will never leave her again."

She flipped forward several pages, tracking Harold's descent month by month. Early entries were coherent—angry but logical, documenting his survival methods, detailing which pipes carried water he could drink, where to steal food from kitchen deliveries, how to move through the passages when guests and staff were sleeping. Plans for sabotage written in careful lists with dates and methods. But by mid-1973, something was shifting:

"June 17, 1973. I hear her now. Not just the building settling—her voice. She speaks in creaks and groans and the rush of water through pipes. She's lonely. She tells me she's glad I stayed. The others don't understand her. They use her without loving her. But I love her. I built her, and I love her."

By 1974, the entries were fragmenting, handwriting becoming erratic:

"She spoke to me last night. Really spoke. I heard her voice through the walls. She said they don't deserve her. She wants me to stay. We are one. Builder and built. Creator and creation. She showed me where to cut the wires. She told me which guests see too much. She protects me. I protect her."

By 1975, Harold was having full conversations with the lodge, recording both sides of dialogues that existed only in his mind. Patricia read one entry from July 1975 that made her voice catch:

"She says the woman in Room 12 knows. I saw her watching the walls yesterday, listening. She told the manager something was wrong. The lodge says I must make her quiet. I don't want to, but the lodge needs me to protect her. I will do it. For her. For us."

That was Sarah Milliken, three months before she disappeared.

Patricia closed the journal carefully, her hands shaking. "He was genuinely brilliant once. An accomplished architect, respected in his field. This"—she gestured at the lair, the obsessive writing, the shrine—"this is tragedy as much as horror. Watching a human mind disintegrate one journal entry at a time."

"Doesn't make him less of a murderer," Donnie said.

"No," Patricia agreed. "But it makes him more human. More understandable. That's worse, somehow."

Rodriguez was photographing the architectural drawings Harold had pinned up—his original designs from 1951, annotated and updated over decades, showing every hidden passage and modification. "These going to the county historical society?" he asked.

"Yes," Owen said. "They're evidence, but they're also history. People need to understand how this happened."

Donnie had moved to the far end of the crawlspace, examining a section Rodriguez hadn't reached yet. "Hey," he called. "There's something else here. You need to see this."

They joined him. In a separate nook, protected from the worst of the fire damage, was a second sleeping area. Distinctly separate from Harold's main pallet, deliberately apart. Smaller. A child-sized blanket, torn and filthy but carefully arranged. Small clothing—rotted fabric, approximately size for an eight- to ten-year-old child. Food wrappers and water bottles, the same age and style as what they'd found in Harold's main area.

Someone else had been up here. Someone small. Someone Harold had made space for.

"The 'small one,'" Patricia said, remembering Mark's audio recordings.

Rodriguez examined the area carefully. "Any remains found here?" he asked.

"No," Owen said. "Police searched thoroughly. Only Harold's body was recovered."

"So either this is from years ago—some vagrant kid who lived here with Harold briefly in the seventies—or Harold had dissociative identity disorder and created this space during alternate personality episodes," Rodriguez said, photographing the evidence.

"Which do you think?" Donnie asked.

Rodriguez shrugged. "I'm a fire inspector, not a psychiatrist. Could be either. Could be something else entirely. File stays open on this detail." He looked at Owen. "Does it matter?"

Owen thought about the breathing on Mark's tape. The small footprints they'd seen. The child-sized evidence that had no explanation fitting their understanding of what had happened.

"I don't know," Owen admitted. "Maybe not. Harold's dead. The case is closed. This is just... a footnote."

But it didn't feel like a footnote. It felt like a question without an answer, a loose thread that suggested their understanding of events was incomplete.

They finished documenting the lair, photographed everything Rodriguez needed for his final report. Owen took Harold's final journal—the one that detailed the fire plan—as a personal record. He needed to remember why this had happened, what had driven his uncle to this end.

Patricia took the architectural drawings. "Historical society will want these. And they deserve to be preserved. Not for Harold, but for the record."

Donnie took several photographs of the obsessive writing on the walls. "Reminder," he said grimly. "Of what isolation does. What happens when you let grudges consume you."

They climbed back down through the ruins, leaving Harold's nest for the last time. In two days, demolition crews would tear down what remained, clearing the foundation, hauling away the rubble. Harold's lair would be destroyed with everything else.

But the evidence would remain. The journals, the drawings, the photographs. The documented proof of eight years of madness and the revenge it had spawned.

As they walked away from the ruins, Owen looked back once. The empty windows seemed to watch him, stone walls standing like grave markers over ash and memory.

Somewhere in that rubble, in the collapsed basement passages, Harold had hidden the bodies of three people. Somewhere in the ruins of the freezer, his own body had been recovered, burned beyond recognition except for dental records.

The lodge had been his creation, his obsession, his grave.

In the end, Harold and Timberline had burned together, just as he'd planned.

Mystery solved. Case closed. Justice served, in its own terrible way.

Except for the small blanket and the tiny footprints and the breathing on the tape that didn't match anyone they'd ever found.

Except for the question that had no answer.

Except for the detail that suggested they still didn't know everything about what had lived in the walls of Timberline Lodge.
