# Chapter 20: Mark's Audio Evidence

While Angie and Patricia organized the emergency supplies, Mark suddenly stopped mid-motion, his hand hovering over a backpack.

"The tapes," he said.

Patricia looked up. "What?"

"My cassette tapes. From before Harold destroyed the camera." Mark was already digging through his bag, pulling out mangled cassette tapes—unwound, damaged, but not completely destroyed. "I've been carrying them this whole time. I forgot—some of the recordings might still be salvageable."

"Mark, we don't have time for—" Angie started.

"No, listen." Mark had his portable cassette player out—battery-powered, small enough to fit in his jacket pocket. "I recorded hours of ambient sound during the first few days. If Harold was watching us the whole time like we think, maybe I caught something."

Owen moved closer. "It's worth checking."

Mark loaded the first tape carefully, working the tangled ribbon back into place with patient fingers. The cassette looked like it had been through a war—housing cracked, label torn off, the tape itself stretched and kinked. But it clicked into the player.

He pressed play.

Static hissed from the tiny speaker, harsh and grating. Then fragments of sound emerged from the noise—footsteps, distant voices, the scrape of movement. Most of it was corrupted beyond recognition, audio warped and distorted by the physical damage Harold had inflicted.

"This isn't going to work," Donnie said after thirty seconds of static.

"Wait." Mark fast-forwarded, the tape squealing. He stopped, pressed play. More static. He tried another section. More nothing. Another attempt. Still nothing but white noise and garbled sound.

The fourth try gave them something. Suddenly, voices emerged from the static—Mark's own voice from days ago, muffled but audible: "...following Owen through the passage... Donnie's checking the structural integrity..."

It was the recording from Chapter 11, when they'd first explored Harold's hidden passages. Mark had been documenting as they moved through the cramped spaces behind the walls.

But beneath their conversation, barely audible, was something else.

A whisper.

Mark's hand froze on the player. "Do you hear that?"

They all crowded closer. Owen could just make it out—a voice underneath the primary audio, like someone was speaking from very far away. Or very close, but very quietly.

Mark turned up the volume as high as it would go.

The whisper resolved into words. Harold's voice, talking to himself in the darkness near them while they'd explored:

"She tells me when they sleep... she shows me their dreams..."

The group went still.

Harold's whispered monologue continued, his voice raspy and childlike: "...they want to kill her, tear her down, but I won't let them... the small one knows too much, sees too much with his machine... must break the machine... fire cleanses all sins..."

Patricia's face had gone pale. "He was right there with us. In the passages. While we were searching."

The recording continued. Harold's voice fading in and out: "...1952, that's when she first spoke to me... during construction... I was building her and she was born and she spoke to me... told me her secrets... told me she was mine forever..."

The whisper cut off abruptly, replaced by static.

Owen felt sick. The intimacy of it, listening to Harold's madness recorded accidentally while they'd been feet away from him in the dark. The surveillance, the proximity, the danger they'd been in without knowing. His uncle had been right there, close enough to touch them, whispering his delusions into the darkness.

"He believes it," Angie said quietly. "He genuinely believes the lodge talks to him."

"Schizophrenia," Donnie said immediately. "Textbook case. Auditory hallucinations, probably visual ones too. Eight years alone in the dark? His brain created company. The lodge became a person to him because he had no one else."

"It makes sense psychologically," Patricia added. "Extreme isolation causes hallucinations in otherwise healthy people. Someone with existing mental health issues, abandoned in darkness for nearly a decade? Of course he'd develop elaborate delusions."

"The 'small one' reference," Owen said, looking at Mark. "He means you. He's been fixated on your camera equipment because you're documenting everything. In his mind, you were a threat because you could expose him, show the world what he'd become."

"That's why he destroyed it specifically," Mark said slowly. "I was 'seeing too much.' Making his existence visible."

Mark was staring at the cassette player. "There's more. Hang on."

He ejected that tape, loaded another. This one was even more damaged, the audio cutting in and out in harsh bursts. Mark fast-forwarded through several minutes of unusable material.

"This is from Chapter 6," Mark said, checking his documentation. "The first night we heard him moving above the lobby. I left the recorder running overnight."

He hit play.

The audio was dark and ambient—the crackle of the fire, shifting bodies, someone's breathing. Then, around what must have been 2 AM, the footsteps started. Heavy, deliberate footsteps on the floor above them. They'd all heard it that night—Harold pacing in the darkness.

But Owen heard something else now.

Beneath the footsteps, almost inaudible, was a second sound. Another breathing pattern.

"Turn it up," Owen said.

Mark maxed the volume. The breathing became clearer—not much, but enough. It was definitely there. Light, quick breaths. Faster than Harold's documented raspy breathing. Different rhythm, different depth.

The pattern suggested someone much smaller. A child. Or someone child-sized.

"That's not Harold," Patricia said.

"Could be an echo," Donnie offered. "Sound bouncing weird in the crawlspaces."

"Doesn't sound like an echo." Mark was rewinding, playing it again. "Listen to the rhythm. It's consistent. Regular breathing, just... smaller."

They listened three more times. The breathing was undeniable. Whoever or whatever was making that sound, it wasn't Harold Reeves.

"Maybe he had help," Angie suggested. "An accomplice. Someone we haven't seen."

"A kid?" Donnie shook his head. "Who keeps a kid in the walls for eight years?"

"Someone insane enough to kill three people and live like a rat," Angie countered.

Patricia was thinking, her analytical mind working through possibilities. "Or it could be auditory pareidolia. Our brains finding patterns in random noise. The power of suggestion—we're listening for something, so we hear it."

"I'm not imagining it," Mark said firmly. "That's definitely a second breathing pattern."

Owen remembered Harold's whispered words: "the small one." He'd assumed Harold meant Mark. But what if Harold was talking about someone else? Something else?

"Is there any other evidence?" Owen asked. "Anything visual?"

Mark shook his head. "Film's all destroyed. These audio fragments are all I have."

They stood in silence, listening to the tape loop again. The footsteps. The breathing beneath them. The impossibility of it.

"So what are we saying?" Donnie asked. "Harold had a kid with him? Or a second person? Or what?"

"We're saying we don't know," Patricia said. "The evidence is ambiguous. Could be accomplice, could be recording artifact, could be something else entirely."

"Or Harold's so crazy he created a second personality," Angie said. "Dissociative identity disorder. The 'small one' could be an alternate identity he shifts into."

Owen thought about the child-sized sleeping area they'd seen in Harold's lair. The small footprints in the dust. Evidence that suggested someone smaller than Harold had been in those passages.

But no second body had ever been found. No missing child reports. No evidence beyond these ambiguous traces.

"Whatever it is," Owen said finally, "it doesn't change tonight. Harold's planning to burn the lodge. We prepare to evacuate. The rest..." He gestured at the cassette player. "The rest is a mystery we may never solve."

"I want to solve it," Mark said quietly. "After we survive, I want to know what this is."

"First we survive," Patricia said. "Then we worry about mysteries."

But Owen saw the look on Mark's face—the intellectual curiosity mixed with dread. They'd stumbled onto something that didn't fit their rational understanding. Harold was explainable: mental illness, betrayal, isolation, revenge. Terrible but human. You could understand how a brilliant man, wronged by his family and abandoned to darkness, could descend into madness and murder. That trajectory made sense, followed psychological patterns documented in textbooks.

The breathing on that tape was something else.

Something that suggested they didn't know everything about what was living in the walls of Timberline Lodge. Something that raised questions Harold's madness couldn't answer.

Owen remembered the local legend Mark had mentioned days ago—"The Keeper," a mountain spirit that protected empty places. He'd dismissed it as folklore then.

Now he wondered.

Mark ejected the tape, tucked it carefully into his jacket pocket. Evidence. Documentation. Proof of the unexplainable.

"We should finish packing," Angie said, breaking the spell.

They returned to their preparations, but the atmosphere had shifted. The temperature in the lobby felt colder, the shadows deeper. Harold was the known threat—mad, dangerous, but ultimately comprehensible. You could fight a man, even a mad one.

The second breathing pattern was different.

It was a question that had no answer, a mystery that defied rational explanation.

And questions like that had a way of haunting you long after the immediate danger had passed.
