# Chapter 19: Fire Warning

They returned to the lobby with Harold's journal clutched in Owen's hands like evidence from a crime scene. Which, he supposed, it was.

Patricia, Angie, and Eleanor looked up as they entered. One glance at their faces was enough.

"What did you find?" Patricia asked.

Owen set the journal on the floor, opened it to the recent entries. "Harold's planning to burn down the lodge. Tonight. He's been stockpiling accelerants throughout the building for years—kerosene, propane, gasoline. He's going to ignite them simultaneously in multiple locations."

Silence.

"How many locations?" Patricia asked, already thinking in numbers and logistics.

"Dozens." Owen flipped through the journal pages, where Harold had mapped it out with frightening precision. "West wing, basement, kitchen, guest rooms throughout all three floors. He's been planning this for years. Once it starts, the whole building will go up in minutes."

"Then we leave." Angie was on her feet immediately. "Right now. We grab what we can carry and we walk out of here."

"Into what?" Donnie gestured toward the boarded windows. "It's got to be fifteen below zero out there with wind chill. Forty miles to town through three feet of snow with no marked trail."

"Better than burning to death," Angie shot back.

"We'd freeze to death in an hour," Patricia said quietly. She'd moved to one of the windows, peering through a gap in the boards. "The storm has broken—I can see clear sky—but the temperature's still deadly. And we have Eleanor. She can barely walk."

Eleanor sat by the fire, her face gray with exhaustion. "Don't stay because of me."

"We're not leaving you," Owen said firmly.

"So what, then?" Angie's voice was rising toward panic. "We just wait for Harold to light his fires and hope we can run fast enough?"

"We hunt him down," Donnie said. "Right now, all of us, we search this place room by room until we find him, and we stop him before he can set the fires."

Mark shook his head. "The lodge is massive. Sixty rooms, three floors, plus basement and attic. Harold can move through the walls—we can't. He could stay ahead of us for days."

"Then we find the accelerants and remove them," Donnie tried again. "Disable his plan before he can execute it."

Patricia was already doing the math, her lips moving as she calculated. "Sixty rooms, plus common areas, plus basement and attic crawlspaces. Five people searching. Harold's journal lists..." she took it from Owen, counted, "thirty-seven specific locations, plus 'additional caches throughout structure.' Even if we assume forty locations total, and work in teams of two with one person staying with Eleanor, that's twenty locations per team. We'd need hours to search properly, and Harold will be actively working against us."

"So we're just going to let him do it?" Angie demanded. "Let him burn us alive?"

"No." Patricia's voice was steady, analytical. "We accept that we can't prevent the fire. But we can survive it."

Everyone turned to look at her.

Patricia continued, laying it out like a financial problem with a calculable solution. "Harold's journal says he acts at nightfall—approximately six PM. That gives us four hours. We use that time to prepare for evacuation. We secure the main exit, create a cleared path through the snow to the equipment shed—it's only fifty yards away, but the drifts are deep. We pack emergency supplies: food, water, blankets, first aid, the portable kerosene heater. We stage everything by the exit so we can grab and go the moment we see flames."

"You want to let him burn it down," Owen said slowly.

"I want us to live." Patricia met his eyes. "The fire will be visible for miles. Every fire department within fifty miles will respond. We survive the first hour in the equipment shed, and rescue comes to us. We don't have to walk forty miles."

Eleanor spoke up, her voice weak but clear. "Harold always acted at night. When I was locked in the room, I'd hear him moving after dark. He feels safe in darkness. During the day, he mostly hides."

"So we have until nightfall," Owen said. "Four hours to prepare."

Angie was staring at him. "You're actually considering this. Letting your family's lodge burn."

Owen looked at the journal, at Harold's meticulous planning, at the years of obsessive preparation detailed in those pages. His uncle had spent eight years planning this moment. There was no stopping it. Harold would die trying if he had to, and he'd probably take some of them with him.

"The lodge is already dead," Owen said quietly. "It died the day my family betrayed Harold. Maybe it needs to burn. Clean slate."

"Owen—" Angie started.

"But we don't need to die with it." He looked at each of them in turn. "We prepare. We get ready to run. And we survive this."

Donnie stood, cracking his knuckles. "All right then. Let's get to work."

They divided the labor. Donnie and Mark took the external work—digging a path through the snow from the main entrance to the equipment shed, clearing the shed interior, and stockpiling firewood. Owen could see them through the window, shoveling methodically, breath steaming in the frigid air. The drifts were waist-deep in places, the snow heavy and wet. Every shovelful was exhausting work, but they moved steadily, creating a trench wide enough for Eleanor to walk through supported between two people.

Inside, Angie and Patricia packed emergency supplies with grim efficiency. Backpacks loaded with food, water bottles, first aid kit, extra clothing, matches, flashlights. They stripped blankets from the bedding stores, found the portable kerosene heater and fuel cans. Angie raided the kitchen one last time, grabbing protein bars, beef jerky, anything that wouldn't freeze solid. Patricia inventoried medical supplies, making sure they had bandages and antiseptic—if someone got burned during the evacuation, they'd need to treat it immediately.

Everything was staged by the main entrance in neat piles, organized for quick loading. They tested the door—the exterior barricade Harold had built days ago was gone now, kicked apart during their preparation work. The path beyond led straight to the shed, marked with broken branches stuck upright in the snow every few feet like a trail of breadcrumbs.

Owen walked through the lodge one last time.

He'd spent his whole adult life here, summers as a kid, working alongside his father to keep the place running. Every room held memories: the lobby where his parents were married, the kitchen where he'd learned to make coffee at age eight, the guest room where he'd hidden during his father's funeral because he couldn't face the crowds.

The place was a decaying monument to failed dreams, but it was his monument. His history. He ran his hand along the lobby's stone fireplace, feeling the individual rocks his grandfather had hauled up the mountain in 1951. The picture windows that overlooked the slopes where he'd learned to ski. The bar where his father used to sit late at night, doing paperwork by lamplight, trying to make the numbers work.

All of it would be ash by morning.

In the office, he found his father's hat hanging on a hook. An old Timberline Lodge cap, faded and sweat-stained. Owen took it, put it on. It fit perfectly.

"I'm sorry, Dad," he said to the empty room. "I couldn't save it. But I can save us. That has to be enough."

Eleanor was in the lobby, rosary beads moving through her fingers, lips forming silent prayers. Owen sat beside her.

"Do you think God forgives him?" she asked quietly. "Harold, I mean. For what he's done."

"I don't know," Owen admitted. "Do you think God forgives the family for what we did to him?"

Eleanor was quiet for a long moment. "I think we're all broken in our own ways. And maybe that's what mercy is for."

The afternoon crept toward evening. The shadows lengthened across the snow outside. The temperature was dropping with the sun—Donnie reported it was already below zero, and it would only get colder through the night.

But the shed was ready. The path was dug. The supplies were packed. They'd done everything they could.

As sunset approached, painting the snow orange and purple through the gaps in the boards, the group gathered in the lobby one final time. They were dressed in layers, boots laced tight, ready to run. Eleanor sat bundled in blankets with a clear path to the door.

Owen checked his watch. 5:47 PM.

"He'll move soon," Donnie said, gripping his wrench.

They waited.

The fire crackled. The wind rattled the windows. Somewhere in the walls, Harold Reeves prepared to destroy everything.

And Owen found himself thinking about the time capsule they'd buried in 1951, when Harold and his father were young men with a shared dream. Before the betrayal, before the madness, before everything fell apart.

The lodge had been built with love.

Maybe it deserved to die the same way.

5:55 PM.

Owen took Angie's hand. She squeezed back, hard.

They watched the shadows and waited for the end.
