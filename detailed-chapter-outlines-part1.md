# DETAILED CHAPTER OUTLINES: The Winter Lodge (Chapters 1-15)

## Chapter 1: Arrival

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Owen, third person limited
**Setting:** Mountain road and Timberline Lodge exterior/interior
**Time:** Late afternoon, November 1980

* **Purpose:** Establish characters, setting, relationships, and isolation while introducing the failing lodge and Owen's burden of inherited legacy.

* **Beats:** Owen drives crew up unpaved mountain road in his Ford Bronco (Angie, Patricia, Mark as passengers; Donnie follows in his pickup). Arrive at Timberline Lodge—massive three-story timber structure, visibly deteriorated, surrounded by early snow and pine forest. Unload supplies while establishing character dynamics: Angie's cutting remarks about Owen selling "his precious legacy," Patricia's businesslike focus on inventory checklist, Donnie's grumbling about storm forecast, Mark filming everything with his Bolex despite complaints. Interior walkthrough—Owen shows Mark the layout (sixty guest rooms, commercial kitchen, lobby with stone fireplace, staff quarters, basement systems). Owen explains lodge history to camera: built 1951, family-owned through his father and uncle, decades of financial trouble, now being sold. Assign sleeping quarters (separate rooms, avoiding intimacy). Fire up heating systems, test landline phone and CB radio. Evening scene: group eats dinner in kitchen, uncomfortable small talk. Mark sets up filming equipment in lobby. Night falls—Owen stands alone in empty lobby, overwhelmed by failure and memory. Final beat: In the walls above him, eyes watch through a hidden peephole. Owen doesn't notice.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Angie needling Owen about selling out family history. Patricia asking practical questions about inventory timeline. Donnie complaining about weather and rushed schedule. Mark interviewing Owen about "death of American dream" and family legacy.

* **Emotional Arc:** Owen begins weary and resigned to failure, carrying guilt about ending family legacy. By chapter end, isolation and melancholy deepen as he confronts the reality of saying goodbye.

* **Key Details:** 1980 period technology (rotary phone, CB radio, film camera, AM radio weather). Timberline's deterioration visible everywhere (water stains, worn carpet, yellowed paneling). Mountain isolation emphasized (forty miles to town, unpaved road, no neighbors).

## Chapter 2: Winterizing

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Multiple perspectives, third person limited
**Setting:** Various lodge locations (guest wings, kitchen, basement)
**Time:** Full day, following morning after arrival

* **Purpose:** Show characters working while introducing subtle wrongness—missing items, unexplained sounds—that foreshadow Harold's presence without revealing it yet.

* **Beats:** Work begins across lodge. Owen and Donnie drain pipes in guest wings, board windows, shut down unnecessary heating zones—physical labor establishing their competence and the building's complexity. Patricia inventories furniture and kitchen equipment in office, discovering financial discrepancies (equipment replaced multiple times for same issue, unexplained maintenance costs spanning decades). Angie in industrial kitchen sorting walk-in freezer, prep stations, organizing for final shutdown—her domain, she's competent and territorial here. Mark films the process, capturing B-roll of empty rooms, deteriorating infrastructure, the crew working. Weather report interrupts on AM radio: major storm developing, arriving 36 hours early. Urgency increases—Donnie insists they can finish if they work faster. First wrongness: Angie finds food missing from locked pantry (canned goods, jerky), assumes Donnie took it without asking—brief argument. Tools disappear from Donnie's workstation, reappear elsewhere—he's frustrated, blames his own distraction. Mark reviews cassette recordings from yesterday's filming, hears faint sounds beneath his narration (breathing, movement, scraping)—dismisses as building settling or equipment malfunction. Decision: work through night to beat storm. Nobody connects the missing items yet.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Donnie and Owen discussing building systems and repairs. Patricia questioning Owen about irregular financial records. Angie confronting Donnie about missing food. Mark asking everyone about lodge's "haunted" reputation (local folklore). Weather updates creating time pressure.

* **Emotional Arc:** Characters shift from resigned boredom with task to increasing urgency as storm timeline accelerates. Underlying tension from missing items creates low-grade paranoia nobody acknowledges yet.

* **Key Details:** Hidden passages hinted at through building sounds (creaking, scraping in walls). Harold's surveillance shown through missing items but characters rationalize explanations. Storm forecast as ticking clock.

## Chapter 3: Trapped

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Owen, third person limited
**Setting:** Lodge interior, focus on lobby and communications
**Time:** Dawn through morning after overnight storm

* **Purpose:** Trap characters in isolated location, raising stakes and eliminating escape options while increasing interpersonal tension under stress.

* **Beats:** Owen wakes to howling wind and discovers storm hit overnight with devastating intensity—three feet of snow, whiteout conditions, wind gusts at 50mph. Vehicles completely buried. Checks exterior—road impassable, visibility zero. Tries landline phone: dead (ice on lines). CB radio still functional. Contacts ranger station—road won't be cleared for minimum five days, possibly seven given storm intensity and low priority for private road. Group assembles for emergency meeting in lobby. Immediate crisis: planned for three-day stay, now facing week-plus with limited supplies. Patricia calculates food, fuel, water rationing. Tension erupts—Angie blames Owen for not evacuating yesterday when they had chance, Owen counters that forecast didn't predict this intensity, Donnie curses the weather and situation, Patricia tries to stay practical, Mark treats it as documentary opportunity (annoying everyone). Owen takes command: assigns heating system monitoring shifts, establishes emergency protocols, inventories all supplies room by room. Secure building against storm damage—check windows, reinforce doors. During inventory, Patricia notices Room 9 key missing from office board—no one remembers taking it. Donnie dismisses it as misfiled. First trapped night: wind screaming, building groaning, darkness oppressive. Group stays in lobby near fireplace, too unsettled to separate.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Blame and recrimination about not leaving earlier. Rationing calculations and survival planning. Donnie's technical explanations of building systems. Angie's sharp criticisms of Owen's decisions. Mark asking if anyone else feels "watched."

* **Emotional Arc:** Shock and denial shift to anger (blame-casting) then reluctant acceptance of trapped situation. Owen forced into leadership role he didn't want, rising to occasion despite self-doubt.

* **Key Details:** Storm as physical antagonist—whiteout, buried vehicles, isolation absolute. CB radio as only lifeline. Missing Room 9 key as first tangible wrongness. Group dynamics fracturing under pressure.

## Chapter 4: Room 9

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Owen and Patricia, third person limited
**Setting:** East wing guest rooms, focus on Room 9
**Time:** Second day trapped, mid-afternoon

* **Purpose:** Introduce Eleanor and the central impossibility—her presence when she shouldn't exist—transforming the story from survival drama to mystery-horror.

* **Beats:** Owen and Patricia inspect east wing for storm damage (broken windows, roof leaks). Notice Door 9 closed—all other guest room doors left open for winterization. Owen doesn't remember closing it, Patricia confirms it was open during her inventory. Approach cautiously, unlock door. Inside: elderly woman (Eleanor) lying on bed, frostbitten fingers/toes, hypothermic, barely conscious, wearing street clothes (coat, dress) not pajamas. She shouldn't exist—lodge was empty, they checked every room, all doors were locked from inside. Panic. Owen lifts her (she's light, frail), Patricia grabs blankets from linen closet. Carry Eleanor to lobby fireplace, begin warming her carefully (Donnie's knowledge: gradual warming prevents shock). Angie provides hot water, blankets, first aid. Group surrounds her, baffled and frightened. Patricia checks guest registry—no entry, nobody checked in. Donnie searches Room 9 and surrounding area: exterior door/window locked from inside, no footprints in snow outside window, no broken glass, no forced entry. How did she get in? Mark films cautiously, documenting impossibility. Eleanor drifts in/out of consciousness, mumbling incoherently. First coherent words, eyes wide with terror: "He's still here... he never left... 1952..." Then lapses back to delirium. Group stares at each other, spooked. Owen asks who "he" is—Eleanor can't answer.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Owen and Patricia's shocked reactions discovering Eleanor. Medical discussion about hypothermia treatment. Donnie reporting no entry points. Angie demanding explanations nobody has. Mark asking who Eleanor is and how she got here.

* **Emotional Arc:** Confusion and fear escalate from puzzle (how did she enter?) to dread (someone else might be here). Owen's protective instinct activates toward vulnerable stranger.

* **Key Details:** Eleanor's frostbite suggests days of exposure. "1952" reference links to lodge construction year. Room 9 becomes focal point of mystery. Physical impossibility of her presence.

## Chapter 5: The Keeper

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Group ensemble, third person limited
**Setting:** Lobby (main gathering space)
**Time:** Evening, same day as Eleanor's discovery

* **Purpose:** Establish competing theories (rational vs. supernatural), introduce Harold's name, and deliver first concrete evidence of someone else in building.

* **Beats:** Group debates Eleanor's presence while caring for her near fireplace. Angie's theory: squatter who hid during final guest season, mental illness explains confusion. Patricia counters: all doors locked, no food/water in Room 9, how did she survive? Donnie suggests she arrived recently, broke in somehow they haven't found. Owen doesn't recognize her but something nags—she seems familiar. Mark researches using old lodge brochures and promotional materials found in office, discovers local legend: "The Keeper," mountain spirit that protects empty places, sometimes traps trespassers who violate sacred spaces. Donnie scoffs—ghost story nonsense. Mark notes Eleanor mentioned "1952"—he finds incident report from lodge records: guest disappeared during storm in winter 1952, never found, search called off. Coincidence? Eleanor wakes briefly, lucid enough to grab Owen's hand with surprising strength: "Harold... he's in the walls... watching us... he never left..." Then incoherent again, releasing him. Owen freezes—Harold was his uncle's name. Refuses to elaborate yet, shaken. Night falls. First undeniable evidence: footsteps in hallway above lobby, clear and deliberate. Everyone hears them. Donnie grabs flashlight, investigates second floor with Owen. Hallway empty—but fresh wet footprints lead from stairwell to wall panel. Donnie touches panel: loose, opens slightly. Behind it: darkness, smell of mildew. Something moved recently. Donnie slams it shut, rattled.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Theories about Eleanor's arrival (rational vs. impossible). Mark explaining "Keeper" legend and 1952 disappearance. Owen's reaction to Harold's name (evasive, troubled). Donnie's skepticism versus mounting evidence. Group deciding whether to explore the wall panel.

* **Emotional Arc:** Intellectual puzzle-solving gives way to visceral fear when footsteps prove they're not alone. Skepticism (Donnie, Angie) confronts evidence (footprints, loose panel, Eleanor's warnings).

* **Key Details:** "The Keeper" legend introduces supernatural red herring. Harold's name planted as key clue. Wet footprints prove recent human activity. Wall panel reveals hidden access to passages.

## Chapter 6: First Night

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Multiple perspectives (shifts between Owen, Patricia, Angie)
**Setting:** Lobby and second floor
**Time:** Night through early morning

* **Purpose:** Escalate dread through direct encounters with Harold's presence—sounds, movement, theft—forcing group to accept danger and barricade themselves.

* **Beats:** Nobody sleeps. Group stays together in lobby, fire burning, Eleanor unconscious near hearth. Owen questions Donnie: are there maintenance passages extensive enough for person to navigate? Donnie admits small crawlspaces exist for pipes/wiring but nothing a person could live in long-term—building isn't designed that way. Mark wants to explore passages immediately; others refuse (too dangerous, too dark, unknown layout). Establish watch shifts. Patricia takes 2 AM shift while others doze. She hears it: scraping in walls behind her, then soft footsteps on floor above (directly over lobby). Wakes Owen quietly—they listen together. Distinct footsteps pacing back and forth, then stopping directly above them. Owen shouts upward: "Who's there?" Silence. Then, faintly through ceiling: high-pitched giggle, childlike but wrong. Everyone jolts awake. Donnie grabs pipe wrench, Owen fireplace poker. Armed search of second floor: hallways empty but doors they'd locked earlier are now open (three separate rooms). Mark's filming equipment moved—camera repositioned, cassette tapes scattered on floor. Kitchen discovery (Angie checks): walk-in freezer door left ajar, specific food missing (canned goods, dried jerky, crackers—survival food, not perishables). Someone is living here, stealing supplies. Return to lobby, barricade doors with furniture. Frightened discussion: should they search now or wait for daylight? Decision: wait, but stay together. Remainder of night spent sleepless, listening to occasional sounds in walls. Wind masks some noises—impossible to tell what's storm and what's human.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Owen and Donnie debating passage accessibility. Patricia describing sounds she heard. Angie's fear masked as anger—demanding action. Mark suggesting they're being watched/studied. Donnie maintaining skeptical explanations (squatter, vagrant). Owen acknowledging they need plan.

* **Emotional Arc:** Transition from unease to primal fear when giggle confirms hostile intelligence. Group cohesion solidifies—petty conflicts subside under genuine threat. Owen accepts leadership responsibility.

* **Key Details:** Giggle establishes Harold's deteriorated mental state (childlike affect). Specific food theft shows calculated survival behavior. Open doors prove someone has keys/access. Barricade represents psychological shift from investigation to defense.

## Chapter 7: Evidence

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Owen and Patricia, third person limited
**Setting:** Office and storage areas
**Time:** Morning, third day trapped

* **Purpose:** Provide breakthrough revelation—Harold's identity and decades-long sabotage—transforming mystery into personal horror for Owen and committing group to confrontation.

* **Beats:** Morning brings exhaustion but clearer thinking. Owen decides: find out who's in the lodge. Retrieves father's files from office—boxes of documents about lodge history, financial records, family papers. Patricia assists, cross-referencing financial records she's been reviewing. Discovery: pattern of incidents (fires, equipment failures, guest injuries, vandalism) dates to 1960, repeats with suspicious regularity every few months for twenty years. Not random accidents—deliberate sabotage. Patricia maps incidents to timeline: they align with family milestones (birthdays, anniversaries, business successes). Someone targeted the family specifically. Mark sets up camera on tripod in second-floor hallway, recording continuously to capture evidence. Donnie begins systematic search of wall panels, finding multiple loose access points throughout building. First major discovery: storage closet on second floor has false ceiling panel. Donnie climbs through into attic crawlspace—large enough to crouch-walk through, extends across entire east wing. Evidence of habitation: bundled blankets (old, filthy), empty tin cans (some rusted, some recent), smell of human occupation (sweat, waste, mildew). He's found where someone lives—but the person isn't there now. While men search building, Eleanor wakes, speaks clearly for first time to Angie and Patricia: "He lured me here... wrote to me six months ago... said he had proof of what they did to him..." Who? "Harold. My brother. They told me he died in 1972, but he wrote letters... he's alive... he's been here all along..." Owen returns, overhears. Confronts Eleanor: Harold Reeves is your brother? She nods. Owen's revelation: Harold was his uncle, his father's brother, disappeared 1972, presumed dead. The saboteur, the hidden occupant—it's Harold, alive, living in the walls for eight years.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Patricia presenting financial evidence to Owen. Donnie describing crawlspace discovery. Eleanor's coherent testimony about Harold's letters. Owen explaining family history and Harold's disappearance. Group debating implications—if Harold's alive and insane, what does he want?

* **Emotional Arc:** Owen's devastation—family curse is real, perpetrated by his own uncle. Horror shifts from unknown threat to intimate betrayal. Group commits to confronting Harold rather than just surviving.

* **Key Details:** 1960-1972 sabotage pattern established. Harold's disappearance in 1972 (Owen was four years old). Attic crawlspace as primary lair. Eleanor reveals herself as Harold's sister. Point of no return—mystery identified, confrontation inevitable.

---

## Chapter 8: Patricia's Discovery

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Patricia, third person limited
**Setting:** Office with financial records
**Time:** Afternoon, continuing same day as Chapter 7

* **Purpose:** Quantify Harold's destruction—sixty-three incidents over twenty years—showing scope of revenge and Owen's father's unknowing victimhood.

* **Beats:** Patricia dives deep into financial records with new context: if Harold sabotaged lodge from 1960-present, paper trail must exist. Methodical analysis: incident reports, insurance claims, repair invoices, guest complaints. Finds pattern: sixty-three documented incidents from 1960-1980. Electrical fires (seven incidents), equipment failures (twenty-three incidents—pipes, heating, lifts), guest injuries from "faulty" infrastructure (twelve incidents—broken railings, collapsing stairs), food poisoning (five incidents), vandalism (sixteen incidents). Insurance claims total hundreds of thousands—enough to bankrupt family slowly through raised premiums and deductibles. Maps incidents to family timeline: Harold's forced buyout (June 1960, first fire occurs August 1960), Owen's father's wedding (1963, multiple incidents that year), Owen's birth (1968, serious equipment failures), Harold's presumed death anniversary (every October since 1972, major incident occurs). It's personal vendetta mapped over decades. Patricia presents findings to Owen in office. He reads documents, face draining of color—his father spent entire adult life fighting this sabotage, died two years ago thinking he was incompetent or cursed, never knowing his brother destroyed him deliberately. Owen's grief and rage. Angie witnesses Owen's breakdown, her anger toward him softens—sees his pain clearly for first time since divorce. Donnie remains skeptical of timeline: how could Harold survive in walls for eight years? Patricia calculates: stealing food regularly from kitchen storage, using lodge utilities (water, heat, electricity), raiding supply deliveries—mathematically possible for determined person who knows building intimately. Mark asks hard question: three guests disappeared in 1970s during storms (found in research)—if Harold's been here since 1972, what happened to them?

* **Dialogue Topics:** Patricia explaining financial forensics to Owen. Owen's emotional response to father's suffering. Angie's rare moment of empathy. Donnie questioning physical possibility of eight-year survival. Mark connecting missing guests to Harold.

* **Emotional Arc:** Patricia's intellectual satisfaction at solving puzzle conflicts with horror at human cost. Owen cycles through disbelief, grief, and rage. Group solidarity deepens—Angie and Owen reconnect through shared pain.

* **Key Details:** Sixty-three incidents quantified. Insurance bankruptcy strategy revealed. Owen's father's death (two years ago) from stress. Three missing guests from 1970s as potential murders.

## Chapter 9: Harold's History

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Owen, third person limited
**Setting:** Lobby, group discussion with flashbacks to Owen's childhood memory
**Time:** Evening, same day

* **Purpose:** Humanize Harold through backstory while establishing his deterioration from wronged man to dangerous villain, and confirm group faces lethal threat.

* **Beats:** Owen recounts what he knows about Uncle Harold to group. Harold was brilliant architect/engineer, designed Timberline's infrastructure and unique features, oversaw 1951 construction. Partnership with Owen's father (brothers): Harold had vision and expertise, father had capital and business sense. By 1960, Harold's behavior became erratic—paranoia, accusations that family was stealing from him, volatile mood swings, talking to himself. Family intervened: competency hearing, psychiatrist evaluation. Harold declared incompetent, bought out for fraction of value, cut from family business. Harold fought legally for years, lost every case, grew increasingly unstable. Last seen 1972 during confrontation at lodge—Owen was four, has fragmented memory: screaming man in office, his father shouting, Harold being escorted out by police, Harold yelling "She's mine! You stole her!" (referring to lodge as "she"). Assumed Harold wandered into mountains that winter and died. Body never found, declared legally dead after seven years. Patricia locates Harold's competency hearing documents in files—psychiatrist noted "delusional attachment to building, refers to structure as living entity, believes it communicates with him." Donnie explores more passages using architectural knowledge, begins mapping them—extensive network, Harold could move through entire building unseen, access every room. Mark reviews all footage from past days systematically—finds Harold: gaunt figure in background of three shots, watching from doorways, vanishing when camera pans. Same person each time: wild white hair, layered filthy clothing, skeletal frame. They've been observed since arrival. Owen asks Eleanor (now lucid): why escalate now after years of hiding? Eleanor explains: Harold's letters said this was "the end," lodge being sold and demolished, his creation destroyed. He wanted her to witness his "justice," validate his grievance. Harold isn't just surviving—he has endgame plan.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Owen narrating family history. Patricia reading psychiatrist's evaluation. Donnie explaining passage network. Mark showing footage evidence. Eleanor describing Harold's mindset from letters. Group debating Harold's immediate intentions.

* **Emotional Arc:** Owen's conflict—pity for Harold's genuine grievance versus horror at his crimes. Group transitions from seeing Harold as abstract threat to understanding him as tragic villain with concrete plan.

* **Key Details:** Harold designed the building (knows it better than anyone). 1960 competency hearing and buyout (Owen's father did wrong Harold). 1972 confrontation (Owen's last memory of uncle). Delusional attachment to lodge as sentient being. Harold's endgame involves the sale/demolition.

## Chapter 10: Red Herring

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Donnie, third person limited
**Setting:** Various lodge locations during search
**Time:** Following morning, fourth day trapped

* **Purpose:** Provide false hope through alternate theory before evidence confirms worst truth, and deepen character dynamics through skepticism versus acceptance.

* **Beats:** Donnie proposes alternative theory to group: maybe Harold did die in 1972, and current saboteur is copycat—former staff member with grudge, business competitor trying to tank sale, vagrant who found Harold's old hideouts and is using them. He argues financial pattern could indicate multiple actors over decades, not one person. Patricia counters with handwriting analysis: pulls maintenance logs from 1960s (Harold's writing, signature on work orders) and compares to recent vandalism found in crawlspaces (words scratched into wood beams)—identical handwriting, same person. Angie supports Donnie's skepticism; accepting Harold is alive means accepting eight years of living like animal in walls, seems impossible. Mark sides with evidence—footage doesn't lie, someone elderly is here now. Owen is torn internally: part of him hopes it's not Harold, that uncle died peacefully rather than descending to this madness. Group decides to search for more evidence. Owen remembers: Harold's possessions were boxed after 1972 disappearance, stored somewhere in lodge. Patricia suggests searching office/storage. They find it: box labeled "H. Reeves - Personal Effects 1972" in basement storage room. Inside: journals (Harold's daily logs from 1960-1972), architectural drawings of lodge with hidden passages marked in red ink, photographs of Harold's family with faces violently scratched out, unsent letters to Owen's father begging for reconciliation and forgiveness (increasingly hostile tone over years). Final journal entry dated October 1972: "They'll never take her from me. The lodge is mine. I built her with my hands. I'll die in her walls before I let them have her. She speaks to me at night. She tells me to stay. We'll be together forever." Donnie reads it, skepticism crumbles—it's Harold, alive, and he's claimed the lodge as his tomb.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Donnie presenting copycat theory. Patricia's handwriting evidence. Angie and Mark taking sides. Owen's internal conflict. Group examining Harold's belongings and journals. Reactions to final journal entry.

* **Emotional Arc:** Brief hope (maybe it's not Harold) dashed by undeniable evidence. Donnie's worldview shaken—he prides himself on rational thinking, forced to accept impossible truth. Group solidarity through shared horror.

* **Key Details:** Handwriting analysis proves single actor across decades. Harold's 1972 journal confirms intention to hide in building. Architectural drawings show Harold mapped every passage. Unsent letters reveal Harold's deteriorating mental state. "She speaks to me" confirms delusional belief in sentient lodge.

---

## Chapter 11: The Passages

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Owen, Donnie, Mark - rotating third person limited
**Setting:** Hidden passages throughout lodge
**Time:** Afternoon, same day as Chapter 10

* **Purpose:** Violate Harold's domain to understand scope of his surveillance and survival while experiencing claustrophobic horror of his living conditions.

* **Beats:** Donnie, Owen, and Mark systematically explore hidden passages using Harold's architectural drawings as guide. Women stay in lobby protecting Eleanor (defensive position). Enter through storage closet panel into attic crawlspace. Network is extensive: behind walls on all three floors, under floorboards, through attic spaces, connecting via vertical shafts. Passages cramped (must crouch or crawl), dark (flashlights only illumination), filled with pipes and electrical wiring—navigable for someone who knows them, death-trap for others. Find multiple caches: stored food (canned goods from different decades—1960s labels mixed with 1970s and recent), water containers (gallon jugs, canteens), kerosene heater (explains how Harold survived winters), blankets and clothing (filthy, layered), tools (hammer, screwdriver, knife). Harold has survived like rat for eight years. Disturbing discoveries: peepholes drilled through walls into guest rooms at eye level, allowing observation of beds. Listening post near office—metal bowls positioned against wall to amplify sound through vibrations (primitive but effective surveillance). Harold watched and listened to guests, staff, family for decades. Mark films everything, becoming nauseated by intimacy of violation. Owen finds sleeping pallet in attic above east wing—Harold's primary nest (from Chapter 7) but closer examination: recent modifications, pallet moved. Harold relocated recently—where is he now? Evidence suggests he's been preparing: new panels cut in walls, routes expanded, supplies moved. Preparing for what? They hear scraping behind them in passage—flashlights swivel, nothing visible but sound of rapid retreat, something moving away fast through passages. Harold knows they've found his home, is watching them now. Donnie notices fresh markings on walls: scratched words "MINE MINE MINE" and "FIRE CLEANSES." Group exits passages shaken, realizing Harold has every advantage—he knows building intimately, can appear anywhere, strike from anywhere.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Donnie navigating using drawings and building knowledge. Owen's horror at peepholes into guest rooms. Mark documenting violations. Discussion of Harold's survival methods. Reaction to fresh markings about fire. Decision to exit when they hear Harold.

* **Emotional Arc:** Intellectual curiosity gives way to visceral disgust and fear. Violation of privacy (peepholes) makes Harold's crimes personal. Realization they're prey in predator's territory.

* **Key Details:** Passage network connects entire building. Peepholes and listening post show decades of surveillance. Multiple supply caches indicate planned long-term survival. "FIRE CLEANSES" foreshadows Harold's plan. Harold's presence confirmed when they hear him retreat.

## Chapter 12: Mark's Footage

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Mark, third person limited
**Setting:** Lobby, group viewing footage
**Time:** Evening, same day as Chapter 11

* **Purpose:** Provide retrospective horror by showing Harold's surveillance of crew since arrival, and reveal his twisted non-aggression had purpose—assessment before endgame.

* **Beats:** Mark develops exposed film using portable field kit (chemicals, changing bag, portable viewer—documentary filmmaker's travel setup). Reviews all footage chronologically. Group watches together on small viewer (taking turns, describing for others). Harold appears in background of multiple shots: standing in distant doorway during arrival (Chapter 1, barely visible), reflection in window during winterization work (Chapter 2, only Mark notices him now), shadow moving in upper hallway (Chapter 3, thought to be coat rack). Always watching, never approaching, studying them. But one shot is different, chilling: Mark left camera running in lobby overnight (Chapter 3, testing time-lapse feature). At 3:47 AM, Harold enters frame from hallway. Approaches Mark's sleeping form on couch. Stands over him for ninety full seconds (Mark counts, horrified), completely still, just staring down. Then Harold reaches out slowly, touches camera lens almost tenderly, strokes the equipment like petting an animal. Retreats into shadows. Mark goes pale watching this—Harold could have killed him, slit his throat while he slept. Why didn't he? Patricia theorizes: Harold is territorial but not immediately murderous, was assessing threats, studying them like animals in his territory. Owen wonders if Harold recognized him (family resemblance to father), knew Owen specifically. Angie asks vital question: if he's been watching for days, why reveal himself now by leaving Eleanor where we'd find her? Mark rewinds to earliest footage, finds answer: arrival day, Mark filmed Owen saying to camera "This is the last trip. We're selling to developers. Whole thing gets demolished in spring." Harold heard. This isn't territorial defense—it's endgame. Harold isn't trying to scare them away; he's preparing to die with his lodge, taking them as final victims/witnesses.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Mark explaining footage chronology. Group's reactions to seeing Harold in background. Discussion of 3:47 AM bedroom surveillance. Patricia's assessment theory. Owen recognizing family resemblance factor. Angie connecting Eleanor's placement to Harold's plan. Mark identifying demolition statement as trigger.

* **Emotional Arc:** Retrospective horror—safety was illusion, they were never safe. Mark's personal terror at bedroom footage. Group realization that timeline is Harold's, not theirs—he's executing a plan.

* **Key Details:** Harold visible in arrival footage (been watching from day one). 3:47 AM surveillance shows restraint/planning, not impulsive violence. Owen's statement about demolition triggered escalation. Harold's plan involves dying with lodge ("taking them with him").

## Chapter 13: Eleanor's Testimony

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Eleanor and Angie, third person limited
**Setting:** Lobby near fireplace
**Time:** Night, continuing from Chapter 12

* **Purpose:** Provide Harold's recent history through Eleanor's account and confirm his immediate plan—burn the lodge with crew inside—starting ticking clock.

* **Beats:** Eleanor fully lucid for first time, recovered enough to tell complete story. Six months ago (May 1980), received letter from Harold—hadn't heard from him in eight years, believed him dead since 1972. Letter was coherent initially: claimed he had proof their brother (Owen's father) forged competency documents to steal lodge illegally, that Harold deserved restitution and family owed him apology. Eleanor initially dismissed as cruel prank—Harold was dead. Harold sent second letter with photos: himself alive, gaunt but recognizable, holding recent newspapers (dated 1980), standing inside Timberline lobby. Shocked, she wrote back to return address (general delivery, town near lodge). Harold responded: insisted she come see evidence in person, wouldn't trust mail or phone with "proof," needed her to witness and tell the world the truth. She debated for weeks, curiosity and concern for brother overcame caution. Arrived three days before crew (early November), stayed at motel in town. Harold contacted her via motel phone in middle of night: gave specific instructions to enter lodge through basement window (he'd unlock it from inside), wait in Room 9 at midnight, tell no one. She complied, thought she could reason with him or get him help. Harold appeared that night—gaunt, wild, terrifying but lucid enough to converse. Showed her architectural drawings, explained years of sabotage as "justice," begged her to witness his "final act" and tell the world the family's crimes. She realized he was completely insane, tried to leave. Harold overpowered her (stronger than he looked), locked her in Room 9, took her car keys and coat. Said she'd understand once "cleansing" happened, needed family witness. She's been trapped for three days before crew found her—no food, minimal water from bathroom tap, freezing (he turned off heat to that wing). Owen asks what "cleansing" means. Eleanor begins crying: Harold spoke obsessively of fire, purification, returning lodge to "pure state before they corrupted her." Plans to burn it down with everyone inside as final justice.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Eleanor narrating six-month correspondence with Harold. Description of Harold's physical/mental state during confrontation. Harold's obsession with "proof" and "justice." Eleanor's horror realizing his insanity. Harold's specific language about "cleansing" and fire. Group questioning timeline and Harold's immediate intentions.

* **Emotional Arc:** Eleanor's guilt for being lured, enabling Harold's plan unknowingly. Group's horror at confirmation—Harold plans mass murder-suicide by fire. Ticking clock starts: when will he ignite?

* **Key Details:** Six-month correspondence shows Harold's planning. Harold unlocked basement window (knows building intimately). "Final act" and "cleansing" language confirms fire plan. Eleanor locked without food/heat for three days (Harold's cruelty/madness). Harold needs witness (Eleanor/crew) for his "justice."

## Chapter 14: First Sabotage

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Donnie and group, third person limited
**Setting:** Basement electrical room and lodge interior
**Time:** Mid-afternoon, following day (fifth day trapped)

* **Purpose:** Escalate from passive surveillance to active attacks—Harold strikes directly, eliminating resources and communication, beginning psychological warfare.

* **Beats:** Mid-afternoon, power cuts out—entire lodge goes dark except emergency lights. Not storm damage (weather has improved slightly)—deliberate. Donnie investigates basement electrical room with Owen (armed with flashlight and wrench). Find main breaker manually thrown to off position, access panel removed from wall, wiring damaged with knife cuts. While Donnie repairs, he hears movement in walls around him—rapid scuttling like large animal, circling his position. Harold is close, watching, maybe ten feet away behind walls. Donnie works frantically, hands shaking, gets partial power restored to essential systems (heating, some lights). Returns upstairs to find more damage: CB radio smashed (case broken, components destroyed), antenna cable cut where it enters building. Their only communication with outside world is gone. Angie discovers small fire in second-floor linen closet—set deliberately with kerosene, burned itself out quickly but charred wall. Warning shot, showing Harold can ignite fires whenever he wants. Mark finds his camera equipment destroyed: film exposed to light (footage ruined), cassette tapes unwound into tangled mess, Bolex camera smashed. Harold is systematically eliminating their resources—power, communication, documentation. Owen tries to organize defense strategy but Angie explodes: they should break through snow, hike forty miles to town, take chances with cold and wilderness rather than wait for Harold to pick them off like animals in trap. Owen argues it's suicide—temperature below zero, storm could return, they'd freeze or get lost within hours. Donnie supports Owen: fortify position, defend lobby as stronghold, outlast Harold until rescue arrives naturally in 2-3 days. Patricia calculates survival: if they barricade in one defensible room, protect remaining supplies, they can outlast Harold. Chapter ends with group barricading lobby entrance with furniture, Eleanor resting by fire, waiting for Harold's next move in tense silence.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Donnie describing electrical sabotage and hearing Harold in walls. Group discovering CB radio and camera destruction. Angie's argument for fleeing versus Owen/Donnie's defense strategy. Patricia's survival calculations. Discussion of Harold's pattern—eliminating advantages before final attack.

* **Emotional Arc:** Shock at direct attacks shifts to survival desperation. Angie's fear manifests as flight instinct. Owen forced to make command decisions despite doubt. Group cohesion tested by strategy disagreement.

* **Key Details:** Power and communication sabotage shows Harold's technical knowledge. Small fire proves he can ignite whenever ready. Destroyed camera eliminates evidence. Barricade represents shift from investigation to siege mentality. Weather improving slightly (rescue coming soon, creating urgency for Harold).

## Chapter 15: Fortification

**Target Word Count:** 1,700 words
**POV:** Owen, third person limited
**Setting:** Lobby and surrounding areas
**Time:** Afternoon into night, same day as Chapter 14

* **Purpose:** Show group's defensive preparations while Owen attempts failed communication with Harold, confirming negotiation is impossible and violence is inevitable.

* **Beats:** Group transforms lobby into defensive fortress. Donnie and Owen drag heavy furniture (tables, cabinets, desks) to block three hallway entrances leading to lobby, leaving only one narrow access path they can monitor. Nail boards over wall panels to prevent Harold accessing from hidden passages (he can still enter via hallways but not surprise them through walls). Patricia conducts detailed inventory of remaining supplies: food for five days if carefully rationed, water from melted snow (unlimited), firewood critical (if heat fails, they freeze)—pile extra logs near fireplace. Angie establishes watch position near kitchen access, keeps chef knives within reach, organizes weapons (knives, fire poker, Donnie's wrench, broken furniture legs). Mark, without camera, becomes record-keeper: writes detailed log of events in notebook, creates timeline of Harold's attacks, documents evidence for potential authorities. Eleanor helps where she can, guilt-ridden that her presence enabled Harold's escalation. During preparation work, group discusses Harold's psychology: Patricia notes eight years of isolation equals severe mental deterioration. Owen wonders if Harold can be reasoned with—family connection might matter. Mark supports trying communication first before violence. That evening, Owen decides to attempt negotiation. Stands in center of lobby, calls into darkness of hallways: "Uncle Harold, I know you're there. I'm Owen—your nephew, your brother's son. We can talk about what happened. We can help you. You don't have to do this." Long silence. Then Harold's voice, raspy from disuse, echoes from walls (impossible to pinpoint location): "This lodge is mine. I built her. You're selling her to murderers. You're all murderers." Owen tries explaining it's just business, family doesn't own things forever. Harold shrieks, voice breaking: "She speaks to me! She tells me what you plan! She wants the cleansing! Fire purifies! Fire brings her peace!" Then silence, total and oppressive. Owen tries calling again—nothing. Harold is beyond reason, consumed by delusion. Group accepts violence is coming.

* **Dialogue Topics:** Donnie and Owen coordinating barricade construction. Patricia's inventory report. Angie organizing weapons. Mark's documentation efforts. Owen's attempted negotiation with Harold. Harold's delusional response. Group processing Harold's madness.

* **Emotional Arc:** Purposeful activity (fortification) provides illusion of control. Owen's hope for peaceful resolution crushed by Harold's response. Resignation settles—they must fight to survive.

* **Key Details:** Lobby barricaded with furniture and boards. Five-day supply timeline. Harold's voice location impossible to pinpoint (uses passages acoustically). "She speaks to me" confirms lodge-as-entity delusion. "Fire purifies" previews imminent attack. Negotiation attempt fails, confirming Harold is irredeemable.
