# Chapter 17: Angie's Confrontation

Angie snapped sometime around noon.

They'd been huddled in the lobby for hours, jumping at every sound, watching the shadows, waiting for Harold's next move. The message on the door mocked them. THE LODGE IS MINE. Angie stared at those words, her jaw clenched so tight Owen could see the muscles working beneath her skin.

She'd been sharpening the same knife for twenty minutes, testing the edge over and over with her thumb. A thin line of blood appeared. She didn't seem to notice.

"Angie," Owen said carefully. "Maybe you should—"

"I'm done waiting." She stood abruptly, knife in one hand, flashlight in the other. "I'm ending this."

"What?" Owen got to his feet. "No. Angie, we agreed—"

"You agreed." Her eyes were wild, edged with exhaustion and fear that had curdled into something harder. "I didn't agree to sit here like a scared rabbit waiting for that psycho to kill us in our sleep."

"We're safer together," Patricia said. "The numbers—"

"Fuck your numbers!" Angie's voice cracked. "He was in here with us last night, Patricia. He stood over us while we slept. Next time he's not going to just watch."

"So what's your plan?" Donnie asked. "Hunt him down? In his building, where he knows every hiding spot?"

"Yes." Angie was already moving toward the barricaded entrance. "Exactly that."

Owen moved to block her path. "I can't let you—"

She shoved him. Hard. Owen stumbled back, surprised by the force of it.

"We're not dying because of your crazy family, Owen." Her voice was low, venomous. "Your uncle, your lodge, your legacy. I'm done. I'm going to find that bastard and put a knife in him, and then we're walking out of here, storm or no storm."

She started pulling furniture away from the entrance.

"Angie, please—"

"Don't." She didn't look at him. "Don't try to stop me. Don't try to protect me. I've spent ten years drowning in your family's shit, and I'm done."

Owen looked at the others. Mark stood, grabbing his flashlight. "I'm going with her."

"That's insane," Patricia said.

"Probably." Mark's voice was steady. "But she shouldn't go alone."

Donnie swore, hauled himself to his feet, and picked up his pipe wrench. "Well, I'm not staying here like a coward while you three get yourselves killed."

Owen grabbed the fireplace poker. There was no stopping Angie now—he'd known her long enough to recognize that set to her shoulders. The best he could do was try to keep her alive.

They left Eleanor with Patricia in the fortified lobby and ventured into the dark hallways.

Angie led, moving fast, checking rooms methodically. She held her knife like she knew how to use it—blade forward, low grip, kitchen-fighter stance. Owen had seen her prep meat for ten years, seen her cut through joints and cartilage without hesitation. She could hurt Harold if she got close enough.

That thought didn't comfort him.

"Come on, you coward!" Angie's voice echoed through the empty second-floor corridor. "I know you're here, Harold! Stop hiding in your fucking walls and face me!"

"Maybe don't antagonize the serial killer," Mark suggested quietly.

"He's already trying to kill us." Angie kicked open another door. Empty room, dust and mothballs. "Might as well make him work for it."

They searched the east wing systematically. Room after room of rotting carpet and peeling wallpaper, furniture covered in sheets, windows boarded over. The smell was oppressive—mildew and old wood and something underneath that might have been kerosene.

In Room 23, they found his nest. The bed was displaced, blankets arranged in a corner with the scent of recent occupation still clinging to them. Food wrappers—their food, stolen from the kitchen—scattered across the floor. The smell of unwashed human body, thick and gagging.

"He's been here recently," Donnie said, touching the blankets. "Still warm."

Angie's flashlight caught something on the wall: scratches in the plaster, frantic and overlapping. Words repeated hundreds of times in cramped handwriting. Mine mine mine mine mine.

"He's close," Owen said, feeling it in his gut. "He's watching us right now."

Angie turned slowly, shining her light into the hallway they'd just come through.

Harold stood fifteen feet away, blocking the corridor.

Angie froze.

Owen's flashlight joined hers, both beams illuminating the gaunt figure. Harold looked even worse in full view—skeleton wrapped in rags and filth, wild white hair forming a halo around his skull-like face. But it was his eyes that stopped Owen's breath. They weren't vacant or mad. They were focused. Intelligent. Studying Angie with predatory intensity.

"You're the one who divorced him," Harold said. His voice was raspy but conversational, almost childlike. "Broke the family line."

Angie raised her knife. Owen saw her hand trembling. "Stay back."

Harold tilted his head, that unnerving bird-like movement. "The lodge told me about you. She doesn't like you. You made him weak."

"The lodge doesn't talk," Angie said, but her voice shook. "You're just crazy."

Harold smiled, revealing the broken teeth, black gums. "She talks to me all the time. She's talking right now. She says you're the disease. You infected him, made him want to sell her."

He took a step closer.

"Harold, stop." Owen moved forward, putting himself between his uncle and his ex-wife. "Please. We don't want to hurt you."

Harold's eyes shifted to Owen, and something changed in his expression. Recognition, maybe. Or hatred.

"You look like him," Harold whispered. "Like my brother. The thief who stole her from me."

"He's dead," Owen said, trying to keep his voice calm. "He died two years ago. Whatever happened between you—"

"He stole everything!" Harold's voice rose to a shriek that echoed off the walls. "I built her! I designed every passage, every room, every secret space! She was mine, and he took her, called me crazy, locked me away!"

"I know," Owen said, hands out, placating. "I know what they did to you. It was wrong. But we can make it right. We can—"

Angie slashed at Harold with her knife.

She was fast, trained by years of kitchen work, but Harold was faster. He dodged with impossible speed, dropping to all fours and scuttling backward like a spider, limbs bent at wrong angles. The movement was inhuman, wrong, and all of them recoiled.

Harold hissed—that same feral sound from the basement—and retreated rapidly down the hallway, still moving on hands and feet, quick as an animal. He reached a wall panel, wrenched it open with one hand, and slipped through the gap. The panel fell back into place.

He was gone.

Angie stood gasping, knife still extended. Her whole body shook. The adrenaline that had carried her this far was crashing hard.

"He moved—" Mark started.

"Like a fucking spider," Donnie finished. "Jesus. How does a seventy-year-old man move like that?"

"Eight years in the walls," Owen said quietly. "He's adapted."

Angie lowered her knife. She was trembling so hard the blade caught the flashlight beam and scattered it across the walls. "I couldn't—I tried to—"

"It's okay," Owen said, reaching for her. "Let's get back to the lobby."

"It's not okay!" She pulled away from him. "None of this is okay! We're going to die here, Owen. He's going to kill us all, and it's because of your family, your fucking cursed family and this lodge—"

"I know." Owen's voice was quiet. "I know it is."

Something in his tone—resignation, maybe, or grief—took the wind out of her anger. She looked at him, really looked at him for the first time in days, and seemed to see past her own fear to his.

"Owen—"

"Let's go back," he said. "Please."

They returned to the lobby in silence. Patricia had reinforced the barricades while they were gone, dragging more furniture into place. Eleanor was asleep or unconscious by the fire, her breathing shallow.

The group settled back into their defensive positions. But the energy had changed. Seeing Harold face-to-face, watching him move in that inhuman scuttling motion, had broken something in all of them.

They weren't dealing with a crazy old man they could overpower.

They were dealing with something else.

That night, Angie sat next to Owen near the fire. The others were trying to sleep, though nobody really did anymore. The wind had picked up outside, rattling the boarded windows.

"I'm sorry," she said quietly.

Owen looked at her. "For what?"

"For blaming you. For saying it's your fault." She stared into the flames. "It's not. You didn't ask for any of this."

"I brought you here."

"I chose to come." She was quiet for a moment. "I've been angry at you for so long. For letting the lodge consume your life, for putting it before us, before me. And now we're trapped here, and I realized—you were as trapped as I was. Maybe more."

Owen didn't know what to say. His throat was tight.

"I never stopped loving you," Angie said, still not looking at him. "I just couldn't live in the shadow of this place anymore. Watching it slowly kill you the way it killed your father."

"It's dying now," Owen said. "One way or another, after this, the lodge is done."

She took his hand. Her fingers were cold, rough from years of kitchen work, familiar.

"What if we can't stop him?" she asked. "What if Harold wins?"

Owen squeezed her hand. He didn't have an answer.

Outside, the wind howled. Inside, the fire crackled. And somewhere in the walls, Harold Reeves moved through his hidden passages, patient and mad and unstoppable as decay.
