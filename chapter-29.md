# Chapter 29: Moving On

Fall 1981. November. One year after Timberline.

Owen had rebuilt his carpentry business in town, working out of a small shop he rented on Main Street. Residential projects mostly—kitchen renovations, deck construction, custom furniture. The work was steady if not lucrative, and he found satisfaction in creating things rather than maintaining a dying legacy. Building something with his hands, seeing it take shape from raw lumber to finished product, felt like redemption.

He lived in a small rental house on the east side of town—two bedrooms, outdated kitchen, but cheap and sufficient. Angie had helped him pick it out three months ago, standing in the empty living room and declaring it "workable." Her approval had mattered more than he'd admitted.

Angie had reopened her catering business. "Angie's Kitchen," professionally printed on business cards she'd designed herself. Started small with church events and wedding receptions, growing through word-of-mouth. She was good—always had been—and people were finally getting to see it without the lodge's shadow obscuring her talent.

They weren't remarried. Weren't even living together. But they had dinner twice a week, spent weekends together, took things slowly and carefully. The relationship was healthier now—boundaries respected, communication improved, no crushing financial burden poisoning every conversation. They talked about real things: hopes, fears, what they wanted from life going forward.

Sometimes Owen would wake from nightmares about the fire and call her at 2 AM, and she'd talk him down without complaint. Sometimes she'd have panic attacks remembering Harold's hands around her throat, and Owen would drive over and just sit with her until dawn.

They were healing. Together but not codependent. It felt fragile and precious.

Patricia sent letters from Denver every few weeks. She'd landed a position at a major accounting firm, thrived in the city environment, mentioned casually in her letters that she was dating someone—an architect named Michael who made her laugh. "We should all get together when I'm in town next," she'd written last month. "I want you to meet him."

When she did visit, they had coffee at a diner on the highway. Patricia looked good—healthy, confident, the haunted look gone from her eyes. They talked about Timberline like veterans discussing an old war: matter-of-fact, acknowledging but not dwelling.

"You doing okay?" she asked Owen.

"Most days, yeah. Some days are harder."

"That's normal. Trauma doesn't follow a schedule."

She'd been seeing a therapist too. They all had.

Donnie sent postcards from his ski resort job two valleys over. The messages were characteristically terse: "Winter season starting. Good snow this year. Take care of yourself." The images were always mountain landscapes—peaks at sunrise, powder days, lodge lights twinkling in dusk. Beautiful, peaceful. Nothing like the memories.

Mark had visited last month, drove down from Denver where he was working on his second documentary project. "The Winter Lodge" film had premiered at regional festivals, won awards, gotten picked up for streaming distribution. Not a major hit, but respected. It had launched Mark's career properly.

He'd given all proceeds to Owen and the victims' families—split five ways, it wasn't much, maybe $4,000 each, but the gesture mattered more than the money.

"I need you to watch something," Mark had said, setting up his laptop in Owen's living room. "Rough cut of the film. Want your approval before final edits."

They'd watched together—ninety minutes documenting Timberline's history, Harold's descent, the week of terror, the aftermath. Mark had balanced it carefully: showing Harold's genuine grievance without excusing his crimes, honoring the victims, capturing the tragedy of mental illness untreated.

Owen had cried during the section about his father. Seeing Jacob Reeves' photo, hearing Mark's narration about a good man fighting an invisible enemy, understanding finally that his father hadn't failed—he'd been deliberately destroyed—broke something open that needed breaking.

"It's good," Owen had said when it ended. "It's honest. That's all I wanted."

"There's one thing I wanted to ask about," Mark had said, hesitant. "The 'small one.' The audio evidence, the child-sized sleeping area. I researched extensively, couldn't find any explanation. The sound engineer says it could be equipment malfunction, echo effects, pareidolia. The physical evidence could be from decades ago, unrelated vagrant. Or Harold's dissociative episodes."

"What do you think it is?" Owen had asked.

"I don't know. And I'm okay not knowing. But if you want me to include it in the film, I will."

Owen had thought about it. The mystery that had no answer. The question that suggested their understanding was incomplete.

"Leave it out," he'd decided. "We know what matters: Harold killed three people, tried to kill five more, and died in the fire. That's the story. The rest is..." He'd gestured vaguely. "Unknowable. And maybe some things should stay that way."

Mark had nodded, seeming relieved. "Agreed."

Eleanor had passed away in February—Owen had attended her small funeral, said prayers for a woman who'd been as much victim as accomplice. Her will had left her modest estate split between the Kohrs, Milliken, and Torres families. Final apology. Final restitution.

Owen attended therapy every Friday afternoon—Dr. Sarah Chen, specializing in trauma and survivor guilt. She'd helped him understand that carrying Harold's actions wasn't the same as being responsible for them. That acknowledging family connection didn't mean accepting blame. That healing was possible even when forgiveness wasn't.

"You can't choose your relatives," she'd told him. "You can only choose how you respond to what they've done. You chose to tell the truth, honor the victims, and build something new. That's enough."

Angie saw a different therapist on Wednesdays. They'd compared notes once—both were working through similar issues, just from different angles. Angie's nightmares were about Harold's face inches from hers, his hands on her throat, the sound of his screaming from the locked freezer.

"I killed him," she'd said one night, lying in Owen's bed after waking from a nightmare.

"You defended yourself and everyone else," Owen had replied. "There's a difference."

"Is there? He still died because of what I did."

"He died because of what he chose to do. You just survived him."

They attended a support group together on Tuesday evenings—families of violent criminals, eight people sitting in a church basement talking about the specific guilt and grief that came from being related to or connected to someone who'd hurt others. Owen and Angie weren't the only survivors, just the newest.

It helped, hearing other people's stories. Knowing they weren't alone in the complicated mess of loving someone who'd become a monster, or being connected to someone whose actions you couldn't undo.

Owen visited the empty lot where Timberline had stood, maybe once a month. The land had sold to a private buyer who planned to let it return to wilderness—no development, no memorial, just forest reclaiming the space. Grass had grown over the cleared foundation. Saplings were taking root. In five years, you wouldn't know a building had ever stood here.

He'd sit on the tree stump at the property edge and just be quiet, working through his complicated feelings. This was where his grandfather had built dreams. Where his father had fought and lost. Where Harold had descended into madness. Where Owen's marriage had crumbled and tentatively begun rebuilding.

So much history compressed into forty acres of mountain land.

But it was just land now. The ghosts were his to carry, not the earth's.

Owen had donated Harold's journals and architectural drawings to the county historical society—evidence of what happened, warning about what untreated mental illness and family dysfunction could create, educational value for future generations. The society had created a small exhibit: "Timberline Lodge: A Colorado Tragedy." Respectful, factual, not sensationalized.

Harold's story was becoming history, fading from headlines to archives.

That felt right.

One Saturday evening in November, Owen and Angie had dinner at a new Italian restaurant in town—her catering client had opened it, given them a free meal as thanks. They sat by the window, watching early snow fall on Main Street, talking about nothing important. Comfortable silence between bites of pasta.

"Do you ever think about leaving?" Angie asked. "Colorado, I mean. Starting completely fresh somewhere else?"

Owen considered it. "Sometimes. Do you?"

"Yeah. Seattle, maybe. Or Portland. Somewhere it rains instead of snows. Somewhere without mountains."

"We could do that," Owen said. "Carpentry works anywhere. Catering too."

"We could." She smiled. "Or we could buy a small house here. Make peace with the place. Prove we're stronger than the memories."

"We could do that too."

"Or..." She looked at him carefully. "We could get remarried. Do it right this time. No lodge, no debt, no ghosts. Just us, figuring it out as we go."

Owen's heart did something complicated in his chest. "Is that what you want?"

"Ask me again in six months," Angie said. "When we've had more therapy and some distance. But... maybe. Yeah. Maybe I want that."

"Okay." Owen took her hand across the table. "Six months. I'll ask again."

They finished dinner, walked out into the November snow. The town was quiet, streets empty, Christmas lights already going up on storefronts despite Thanksgiving being two weeks away.

Owen thought about the time capsule sitting on his bookshelf at home—evidence that Harold and Jacob had loved each other once, built something beautiful before it all fell apart.

Maybe the lesson wasn't that love failed. Maybe it was that love existed at all, even temporarily, even imperfectly.

That was enough to build on.

That was enough to try again.

Life continued after horror. Not unchanged, not without scars, but continued nonetheless.

And Owen was finally learning to live in the aftermath, to choose hope over guilt, to build rather than mourn.

One day at a time.

One choice at a time.

Moving forward, slow and careful, into whatever came next.
