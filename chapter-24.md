# Chapter 24: Rescue

The night in the equipment shed was the longest of Owen's life.

They survived on the emergency supplies they'd prepared—the portable kerosene heater provided just enough warmth to prevent hypothermia, sleeping bags and blankets distributed among the five of them, huddled close for shared body heat. They rationed the food, though no one was hungry. Water bottles frozen solid had to be melted near the heater.

Patricia monitored Eleanor constantly, checking her pulse, her breathing, her skin temperature. The elderly woman drifted in and out of consciousness, murmuring sometimes, silent others. The hypothermia and stress had pushed her fragile system to its limits.

Angie's injuries were cleaned and bandaged as best they could with the first aid kit. The bite wound on her forearm was the worst—deep punctures that would definitely scar. The knife slash was shallow but painful. Burns on her hands and face would heal. Her throat was bruised purple from Harold's grip.

Donnie had minor burns where his coat had caught fire. Mark's smoke inhalation was bad—he coughed constantly, a wet, rattling sound that worried everyone. Owen's lungs burned with every breath, but he'd survive.

They were alive. That was what mattered.

Outside, Timberline Lodge burned through the night.

Owen watched through the shed's small window, unable to look away. The flames were visible for miles, a beacon on the mountain. Fire departments from three counties would see it, respond eventually. But the roads were still being cleared—rescue wouldn't come until morning.

The west wing collapsed around midnight, the sound like a controlled demolition. The east wing went an hour later. By two AM, the main structure's roof caved in, sending a column of sparks hundreds of feet into the clear night sky.

By dawn, only the stone shell remained—blackened walls standing like a monument, empty windows staring out at nothing. Everything wooden, everything that had made it a lodge rather than just a pile of rocks, was ash.

Owen watched the sun rise over the ruins and felt nothing. He was too exhausted for grief, too numb for anything except a hollow acceptance.

His family's legacy was gone.

Angie shifted beside him, awake. She'd been dozing against his shoulder, her breathing shallow and pained. "It's over," she said quietly.

"Yeah."

"How do you feel?"

Owen considered the question. "Empty."

She took his hand. They sat together in silence, watching smoke drift from the ruins.

Around nine AM, they heard engines.

Distant at first, then growing louder—the growl of heavy machinery. Snowplows clearing the road. Then smaller engines, higher-pitched. Vehicles.

"They're here," Donnie said, moving to the door.

Rescue had arrived.

The group stumbled out of the shed into brilliant morning sunlight. The snow was blinding white, the sky impossibly blue. Three vehicles were parked on the cleared road: a county sheriff's SUV, two ambulances, and a fire department pickup truck with emergency lights flashing.

Sheriff Dwight Morrison was the first to reach them—a man in his fifties, heavy coat over his uniform, concern etched on his weathered face. "Jesus Christ. You're the lodge crew?"

"Yeah," Owen said. His voice was hoarse, barely audible. "We're all alive. One needs immediate medical attention." He gestured to Eleanor.

Paramedics moved in immediately, assessing everyone with practiced efficiency. Eleanor was loaded onto a stretcher within minutes, oxygen mask over her face. The others were checked for injuries, smoke inhalation, hypothermia.

"What happened?" Morrison asked Owen. "We got the fire report hours ago, but couldn't get through until the plows cleared the road. Fire department's on the way, but they're still thirty minutes out."

Owen looked at the ruins, then back at the sheriff. Keep it simple for now. "Early season storm trapped us here five days ago. Last night, electrical fire started—old building, bad wiring, spread too fast to fight. We evacuated to the shed."

Morrison frowned, looking past Owen at the destroyed lodge. Even from here, even to an untrained eye, something looked wrong about it. Too thoroughly destroyed, too uniform.

"Electrical fire," Morrison repeated, skeptical.

"That's what we thought at first," Owen said carefully.

The paramedics were loading everyone into the ambulances. Morrison helped Owen toward the nearest one. "We'll talk more at the hospital. Get you checked out first."

The ride down the mountain was surreal. Owen sat in the back of the ambulance with Patricia and Mark, oxygen masks over their faces, blankets wrapped around their shoulders. Angie was in the other ambulance with Donnie and Eleanor.

Patricia leaned close to Owen, pulled her mask aside. "Do we tell him?" she whispered. "The truth about Harold?"

Owen glanced at Mark, who nodded. "We have to," Mark said quietly. "There's evidence in the ruins. Three bodies in the crawlspaces. Harold's body in the freezer. They'll find it all when they investigate. Better if we tell them first."

"And if they don't believe us?" Patricia asked.

"I have the journal," Owen said. He'd grabbed it during the evacuation, stuffed it in his pack along with some of Harold's architectural drawings. Physical evidence. Proof. "We have documentation. They'll believe us eventually."

At the county hospital in town, they were separated for treatment. Eleanor was admitted immediately, critical condition from hypothermia and dehydration. The rest of them were treated for smoke inhalation in the emergency room, given oxygen, examined by doctors, bandaged and medicated.

Owen sat in a hospital gown in an exam room, breathing oxygen through a mask, when Morrison returned.

"Alright," the sheriff said, pulling up a chair. "Fire inspector just radioed from the site. Found evidence of accelerants—kerosene, gasoline, propane. Multiple ignition points throughout the structure. This wasn't an electrical fire, Mr. Reeves. This was arson."

Owen pulled off the oxygen mask. "I know."

Morrison's expression hardened. "You want to tell me what really happened?"

Owen took a breath, feeling it rasp in his damaged lungs. "How much time do you have?"

"As much as you need."

Owen reached for his pack, pulled out Harold's journal and the architectural drawings. He set them on the exam table.

"My uncle," Owen said. "Harold Reeves. He was presumed dead in 1972—disappeared after a confrontation with my father, everyone thought he wandered into the mountains. He didn't. He'd been living inside the lodge's walls for eight years. Sabotaging it. And three nights ago, he tried to kill all of us."

Morrison stared at him. "Your uncle was living in the walls."

"Yes. He designed the lodge's infrastructure in 1951, built hidden passages for maintenance access. After my family bought him out—against his will, had him declared incompetent—he started sabotaging the business. Small things at first. Then he faked his death and moved into the hidden spaces permanently."

Owen opened the journal, showed Morrison the entries. "This documents everything. Years of sabotage. Plans to burn the lodge down. Three missing guests from the 1970s—he murdered them when they discovered him. Their bodies are in the crawlspace behind the basement boiler room. You'll find them when you search."

Morrison took the journal, flipped through pages, his expression shifting from skepticism to dawning horror. "This is real."

"Yes."

"And your uncle? Where is he now?"

"Dead," Owen said quietly. "In the walk-in freezer. Angie—my ex-wife—locked him in during the evacuation. He died in the fire."

Morrison was silent for a long moment, reading Harold's meticulous handwriting, the obsessive documentation of decades of madness.

"I need to talk to your whole group," he said finally. "Get everyone's statements. And I need these documents for evidence."

"They're yours."

"The architectural drawings—these show the hidden passages?"

"Every one. Harold marked them all."

Morrison stood, taking the journal and drawings. "Fire department and investigators are at the site now. If what you're saying is true—if there are bodies, if there's evidence of your uncle living there—they'll find it."

"It's true," Owen said. "All of it."

Morrison looked at him for a long moment. "Get some rest, Mr. Reeves. This is going to be a long investigation."

They were released from the hospital that afternoon—everyone except Eleanor, who remained in intensive care. The sheriff's department put them up in a motel in town, two rooms, all expenses covered.

Owen lay on a motel bed that smelled like industrial detergent and stared at the water-stained ceiling. In the next room, he could hear Patricia and Mark talking quietly. Donnie had gone to his own room. Angie sat in the chair by the window, looking out at the parking lot.

"Do you think they believe us?" she asked.

"They will," Owen said. "When they find the evidence. When they see what Harold built in those walls."

"And then what?"

"Then it's over. Truly over."

Angie turned to look at him. "What are we going to do, Owen?"

"I don't know." He was too tired to think about the future. "Survive. Figure it out. Start over."

She came to the bed, lay down beside him. They didn't speak. Just lay there together, alive, while somewhere up the mountain, investigators combed through the ruins of Timberline Lodge and discovered the full scope of Harold Reeves' madness.

The truth was coming out.

Finally, after eight years, Harold's secrets were being exposed to light.
