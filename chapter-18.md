# Chapter 18: The Lair

"We can't keep playing defense," Donnie said. It was morning—their seventh day trapped in the lodge, though it felt like months. "Harold's got us pinned down, and he's just going to keep wearing us down until we're too exhausted to fight back."

Owen looked up from the architectural drawings spread across the floor. They'd been studying them for an hour, tracing Harold's hidden passages through the building's infrastructure. "What are you suggesting?"

"We go on offense. Find his main nest, destroy his supplies, flush him out into the open." Donnie tapped the drawings with a thick finger. "Make him fight on our terms instead of his."

"He knows this place better than we do," Patricia pointed out. "And he's proven he can move through those passages faster than we can."

"True." Donnie leaned over the drawings. "But he's got to have a primary base. Somewhere he sleeps, keeps his main supply cache. We find that, we might find something useful. Maybe figure out his plan."

Owen studied the drawings. Harold had been meticulous—every passage, every crawlspace, every hidden access point was marked. There were dozens of them, a network spanning the entire lodge. But one space was marked with asterisks, emphasized: the attic crawlspace above the east wing.

"Here," Owen said, pointing. "This is the largest space. Wraps around the chimney, runs the length of the wing. If I were living in the walls, this is where I'd make my main camp."

Mark peered at the drawings. "We found bedding up there before. In Chapter—I mean, a few days ago. When we first explored the passages."

"But we didn't go deep," Donnie said. "Just looked in and backed out. If that's really his nest, we need to search it properly."

Angie crossed her arms. "And if you run into Harold while you're crawling around in his tunnels?"

"Then we deal with him." Donnie hefted his pipe wrench. "Three of us, one of him. Better odds than waiting for him to pick us off one by one."

Owen looked at Patricia and Angie. "You two stay here with Eleanor. Keep the barricades secured. We'll be an hour, maybe less."

"And if you don't come back?" Angie asked quietly.

"Then take Eleanor and get out. Walk to town if you have to. Don't wait for rescue." Owen met her eyes. "Promise me."

She didn't promise. But she nodded.

They went armed: Donnie with his wrench, Owen with the fireplace poker, Mark with the largest flashlight and his camera—even destroyed, he carried it like a talisman. The accessed the east wing through the second-floor hallway, then found the storage closet Harold's drawings indicated.

Inside, behind stacked boxes and old cleaning supplies, was a panel in the ceiling. Owen climbed on a chair and pushed it aside. Darkness yawned above.

"I'll go first," Donnie said.

"It's my uncle," Owen replied. "My family's mess. I go first."

He pulled himself up before Donnie could argue.

The attic crawlspace was larger than he'd expected—not quite tall enough to stand in, but high enough to crouch comfortably. The air was close, thick with insulation dust and the smell of old wood. And something else. Human occupation. Sweat and waste and years of breathing the same recycled air.

Donnie came up behind him, then Mark. They turned on their flashlights.

The beams revealed Harold's world.

The nest was directly ahead, built around where the stone chimney rose through the attic space. Warmth from the flue below had created a habitable area, and Harold had made it his home.

A sleeping pallet dominated the space—layers upon layers of stolen guest linens, blankets from the 1950s mixed with ones from the 1970s, all filthy but carefully arranged. A kerosene heater sat nearby, the source of multiple lodge "accidental" fires over the years. Cans of food were stacked in careful rows, organized by type: vegetables, meats, soups. Some tins were ancient, labels faded to illegibility. Others were recent—the supplies Harold had stolen from their kitchen.

"Jesus," Mark whispered. "He's been living up here for eight years."

But it was the walls that stopped them cold.

Every surface was covered in writing. Harold had written on the wooden beams, the plywood, the insulation backing—anywhere he could scratch or scrawl words. The same phrase repeated thousands upon thousands of times in obsessive spirals that covered every inch:

THE LODGE IS MINE THE LODGE IS MINE THE LODGE IS MINE THE LODGE IS MINE

The handwriting varied—sometimes precise and careful, sometimes frantic and overlapping, layers upon layers where he'd written over old words with new ones. Years of repetition, a mantra carved into his mind and expressed onto every surface of his hidden world.

"This is what eight years alone does to you," Donnie said quietly.

Owen's flashlight found the shrine.

Against one wall, Harold had created a gallery. Photographs, dozens of them, pinned to the wood with nails and tacks. Owen recognized his father in several—young in some, older in others—but in every photo, the eyes had been viciously scratched out with something sharp. Gouges so deep they went through the photograph paper.

There were pictures of Owen himself, starting from when he was maybe four years old. Harold must have taken them secretly, watching from the walls even back then. Owen as a child, as a teenager, as a young man. Watching him grow up from the shadows. In the more recent photos, Owen's eyes were scratched out too.

Eleanor's picture was there, with TRAITOR written across her face in what looked like dried blood.

"He's been watching your whole life," Mark said, horrified. "Since you were a kid."

Owen couldn't speak. The violation of it, the decades of surveillance, the hatred focused and cultivated in this dark space—it was overwhelming.

Donnie had moved to another section of the lair. "Owen. You need to see this."

More photographs. These ones were older, from the 1970s based on the clothing and quality. Three sets of photographs, each marked with a red X drawn over the person's face.

Owen recognized them from the missing persons reports: Dennis Kohr. Sarah Milliken. Paul and Jean Torres.

The three guests who'd vanished from Timberline Lodge and were never found.

Beneath the photographs, Harold had arranged their belongings like trophies. A man's watch, tarnished with age. A woman's ring. A wallet with identification cards visible through yellowed plastic. Bloodstained clothing, folded carefully.

"He killed them," Owen said. "They found him, discovered he was living here, and he murdered them."

"We're standing in a serial killer's den," Mark's voice was thin. "This is evidence. We need to—"

"Look at this." Donnie was holding a journal, leather-bound and worn. He flipped it open, shining his light on the pages.

Harold's handwriting filled the pages, but these entries were recent. Owen recognized the dates—November 1980. This week.

Donnie read aloud: "The nephew came today with his crew. They're closing her. Selling her to developers. They'll tear her down, rip her apart, destroy everything I built." He flipped forward. "She told me what I have to do. Fire purifies. Fire cleanses. I've been preparing for years, stockpiling the fuel, learning the patterns. Tonight. Tonight I'll set her free, send her to heaven in flames, pure and untouched by their greed."

Owen grabbed the journal, scanned the recent entries. Harold had detailed everything: locations throughout the lodge where he'd hidden accelerants—kerosene, propane tanks, gasoline. He'd mapped out ignition points, calculated timing, planned the fire with the same meticulous attention he'd once used to design the building.

A final entry, dated yesterday: "The nephew looks like my brother but younger. Maybe he understands. Maybe he'll stay willingly. Fire cleanses. Tonight the lodge and I become one. Anyone still inside joins us in purification."

Owen's hands shook. "He's going to burn it down. Tonight. With all of us inside."

"We need to get out," Mark said immediately. "Now. We take Eleanor and we break through the snow—"

"And freeze to death before we make it a mile," Donnie interrupted. "Storm might be over but it's still below zero out there."

"So what do we do?" Mark demanded.

Owen stared at the journal, at the mad scribblings of a brilliant mind destroyed by isolation and betrayal. His uncle had spent eight years planning this. Harold had hidden accelerants throughout the massive lodge—they'd never find and remove them all in time.

"We prepare to evacuate," Owen said quietly. "We can't stop the fire. But we can survive it. We dig an escape route through the snow to the equipment shed, stockpile emergency supplies, and get ready to run the moment he lights it."

"You want to let him burn it?" Donnie asked.

"I want us to live." Owen looked around the lair—at the obsessive writing, the shrine to decades of hatred, the evidence of murders—and made his choice. "The lodge is already dead. It died the day my family stole it from Harold. Maybe it deserves to burn."

He grabbed Harold's journal and architectural drawings. "Come on. We've got maybe twelve hours before nightfall. That's when he'll do it. That's when he always acts."

They climbed back down from the crawlspace, taking the evidence with them.

Behind them, in the darkness of his violated nest, Harold Reeves huddled in a secondary passage and listened to them leave. His home, his private world, exposed and invaded. The lodge whispered to him, telling him what he already knew.

Tonight. It had to be tonight.

Fire cleanses everything.
