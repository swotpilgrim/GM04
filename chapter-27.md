# Chapter 27: The Missing Guests

Two weeks after the fire, Owen sat in a conference room at the sheriff's office and learned the full stories of Harold's three victims.

Morrison laid out the files one by one—police reports, missing persons cases, family statements, the documentation of lives interrupted and never continued.

**Dennis Kohr.** Thirty-four years old in January 1974 when he checked into Timberline Lodge. Traveling salesman from Omaha, Nebraska, selling industrial cleaning supplies to mountain resorts. Married, two kids—Jennifer, age six, and Michael, age four. His wife Alice had reported him missing when he didn't return from his business trip. The lodge confirmed he'd checked in, stayed two nights, and then vanished. His car was still in the parking lot, luggage in his room, wallet and ID left behind.

Massive search operation. Helicopters, search dogs, volunteers combing the mountain for weeks. Nothing. The assumption was that Dennis had gone for a walk, gotten disoriented in a sudden snowstorm, fallen and died of exposure. His body would turn up in spring when snow melted, they'd thought.

It never did.

Case went cold. Alice Kohr raised two children alone, never knowing if her husband had died or abandoned them.

Harold's journal entry from January 12, 1974: "D. saw me in the hallway last night. Tried to follow me to the passage. I had to stop him. Hit him with the wrench when he came through the panel. The lodge told me it was necessary. Protected her. Hid him in the deep space."

**Sarah Milliken.** Twenty-eight years old in October 1975. Solo traveler and freelance writer from Portland, Oregon, researching a book about Colorado mountain communities. Checked into Timberline alone, planning to stay a week, interview locals, document the dying ski resort culture.

Her final journal entry, dated October 8, 1975, found in her room after she disappeared: "Something's wrong with this place. I keep hearing sounds in the walls—not pipes, not the building settling. Movement. Breathing. I told the manager (Owen's father, Owen realized), but he dismissed it as old building noises. I saw someone in the hallway last night. Brief glimpse, just a shadow, but it moved wrong. Too fast, too low. I'm going to investigate tonight. Document whatever this is."

She never wrote another entry.

Family reported her missing three days later when she didn't call. Room was empty, her belongings packed as if for departure, but her car was still parked outside. No trace. Search conducted, no results. Police theorized she'd gone hiking and gotten lost or met with foul play from a transient.

Harold's journal, October 9, 1975: "She was getting too close. Listening at the walls. Taking notes. The lodge said she would expose us. I waited until she came looking, then I protected us. The lodge is safe. She keeps me safe. I keep her safe. That's love."

**Paul and Jean Torres.** Forty-one and thirty-nine years old respectively in December 1977. Married twenty years, no kids, celebrating their anniversary with a mountain getaway. They'd booked the honeymoon suite at Timberline for three nights.

After two nights, housekeeping found their room empty. Luggage still there, clothes in the closet, Paul's wallet on the dresser. But no sign of the couple. Their car was in the lot. No checkout, no note.

Extensive investigation. FBI got involved because it was a potential abduction. Hundreds of interviews, forensic examination of the room, searches of the surrounding wilderness. Nothing.

The Torres family—siblings, nieces and nephews—spent decades believing Paul and Jean had staged their disappearance, run away to start new lives. It became family mythology: the aunt and uncle who'd been unhappy and vanished.

Harold's journal, December 14, 1977: "The couple found the panel behind the armoire. I heard them opening it, saw them with flashlights. They were going to tell. Going to bring others. Couldn't let them. Trapped them in the deep space, sealed the panel. They screamed for a long time. The lodge said it had to be done. She protects me. I protect her."

Scratch marks on the interior walls where Paul and Jean Torres had tried to claw through two inches of wood before suffocating in darkness.

Owen read all three files until his vision blurred with tears. He'd known intellectually that Harold had murdered these people, but seeing their faces in the photographs—Dennis smiling with his kids, Sarah in her author headshot, Paul and Jean on their wedding day—made them real.

Three families destroyed. Children who grew up without fathers. Siblings who never knew what happened. Decades of uncertainty and grief.

All because of his uncle. His family.

Morrison arranged meetings with the families over the following week.

Dennis Kohr's parents—Walter and Martha, both in their eighties now—came from Nebraska. They sat across from Owen in the conference room, holding hands, looking decades older than their years.

"We just need to understand," Walter said, his voice trembling. "Why our son? What did he do?"

"He saw something he shouldn't have," Owen said carefully. "Harold was living in the walls. Dennis discovered him, tried to follow him. Harold..." He couldn't finish.

"Killed him," Martha said flatly. "To protect his secret."

"Yes."

Martha started crying. Walter put his arm around her, his own face crumbling. "Forty years," he whispered. "Forty years we thought maybe he'd walked away from us. From Alice and the kids. Thought maybe we'd done something wrong, hadn't been good enough."

"You didn't do anything wrong," Owen said. "None of this was your fault. It was Harold. It was my family. I'm so sorry. I know that's not enough, but I'm sorry."

"Alice died five years ago," Walter said. "Never knowing. The kids are in their thirties now. They grew up thinking their father abandoned them."

Owen had no words. What could he possibly say?

Sarah Milliken's sister Rachel came from Portland, mid-fifties, sharp-suited, carrying forty years of rage.

"Your family murdered my sister," she said without preamble. "Murdered her and hid her body for decades while my parents died never knowing what happened. You're going to pay for that."

"I'll do whatever I can," Owen said. "I know money doesn't—"

"Money?" Rachel laughed bitterly. "You think I want money? I want my sister back. I want my parents to have known the truth before they died. I want justice, and your uncle is already dead, so I can't have that either."

"I'm sorry."

"Stop saying that. Sorry doesn't fix anything." She stood, trembling with anger. "Sarah was twenty-eight. She was brilliant, talented, her whole life ahead of her. And your insane uncle murdered her because she heard him crawling around in the walls like a rat. How is that fair? How do I forgive that?"

"You don't," Owen said quietly. "You shouldn't. It's unforgivable."

Rachel stared at him, some of the rage deflating into grief. "Did she suffer?"

Owen glanced at Morrison, who nodded slightly. Tell her the truth.

"The coroner believes it was quick," Owen said. "Blunt force trauma. She probably didn't know what was happening."

That was a lie—Sarah's defensive wounds suggested she'd fought—but it was a merciful lie.

Rachel left without another word, and Owen didn't blame her.

The Torres children were hardest. Maria, forty-three, and Robert, forty-one—barely teenagers when their parents vanished. They came together, sat close, looked lost.

"We thought they left us," Maria said. "Our whole lives, we believed they didn't love us enough to stay. That the marriage was unhappy, that they'd escaped together. We blamed ourselves for not being good enough kids."

"They didn't leave," Owen said. "They loved you. They were murdered."

"We know that now," Robert said. "And somehow that's worse. Forty years of being angry at them for abandoning us, and they were dead the whole time. Dead in that building while we lived our lives hating them."

"Your uncle took our parents and our memories," Maria added. "We can't even grieve properly because we've spent four decades feeling the wrong things."

Owen had no comfort to offer. Just apologies that meant nothing. Just the truth that had come forty years too late.

"We're planning a memorial service," Maria said. "Now that we have... remains. Will you come?"

"If you want me there, yes."

"We do," Robert said. "You're the only living connection to what happened. To their final days. We need you there."

The media coverage intensified through all of this. National news picked up the story. True crime podcasts devoted episodes to "The Man in the Walls." Comparisons to other hidden killer cases. Think pieces about mental illness, family obligation, and inherited guilt.

Timberline Lodge became a cautionary tale, a horror story, a legend.

Eleanor, recovered enough to leave the hospital, made a public statement apologizing for not recognizing Harold's danger when he'd contacted her. She established a small fund from her savings for the victims' families.

Owen sold the land—forty acres of mountain property with dark history—for a fraction of what it would have been worth before. The money went to legal fees, victim restitution, and paying off the lodge's remaining debts.

When everything was settled, he had $3,000 to his name and no property.

But three families had answers. Three sets of remains were finally laid to rest properly. Three murder cases were closed.

The scope of Harold Reeves' destruction was finally fully documented: sixty-three sabotage incidents spanning twenty years, three murders, fifteen injury claims, financial ruin that killed Owen's father from stress, five attempted murders, and immeasurable grief spreading through multiple families across decades.

One man's inability to let go of betrayal. One man's descent into madness. One man's revenge.

The cost was incalculable.

And Owen carried the weight of it—not guilt for crimes he didn't commit, but responsibility for bearing witness, for telling the truth, for honoring the victims by remembering them.

Harold was his family.

That was a fact he'd live with forever.
