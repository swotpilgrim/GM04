# Chapter 15: Fortification

Morning brought no comfort.

Owen woke stiff and sore. The fire had burned low. Donnie was already feeding logs into the fireplace.

"Sleep?" Donnie asked.

"Some." Around the lobby, the others stirred. The furniture barricades loomed at the hallway entrances.

No attacks during the night. Harold had been quiet.

Too quiet.

"We need to finish fortifying," Owen said. "Seal the wall panels."

Donnie nodded.

They found plywood sheets in the basement storage—leftovers from old repairs, dusty but solid. Donnie grabbed his hammer and a box of nails. Together they began the methodical work of sealing Harold's access points.

Each wall panel in the lobby got covered. Donnie would run his hand along the wall, feeling for the almost-invisible seams where panels opened into passages. When he found one, Owen would position a plywood sheet over it.

"Here," Donnie said, tapping the wall near the registration desk. "This one opens into the east wing."

Owen held the board in place while Donnie hammered. Each nail sank with satisfying finality. Bang. Bang. Bang.

They worked their way around the perimeter. Five wall panels total—five potential entry points for Harold to slip through walls and attack from behind. Each one now sealed with plywood and nails.

"He can still get in through the hallways," Patricia observed, watching them work.

"But not through the walls," Donnie said, testing one of the boards with his hand. Solid. "No more surprise attacks from behind us. He'll have to come through the barricades where we can see him coming."

Mark had taken on a new role without his camera. He sat at a table with a spiral notebook, writing detailed accounts of everything—timeline of Harold's attacks, descriptions of evidence, character profiles, their defensive preparations.

"If we don't make it," Mark said, not looking up from his writing, "at least there'll be a record. Authorities will know what happened here."

"We'll make it," Angie said, but her voice lacked conviction.

Eleanor helped despite her frostbitten fingers. She moved slowly along the food supplies, organizing cans by type, counting portions. Her blackened fingertips trembled with each movement, but she didn't stop. Guilt drove her like penance.

"I'm sorry," she said quietly to no one in particular. "I brought this down on all of you. If I hadn't answered his letters, if I hadn't come—"

"Harold would still be here," Owen interrupted gently. "Still planning his endgame. You didn't cause this. My family did, decades ago."

"But I enabled it. Gave him an audience for his madness."

Eleanor set down a can of soup, stared at her damaged hands. "The letters were coherent at first. He wrote about justice, about proof, about wanting me to witness the truth. But by the end..." She swallowed. "The handwriting became jagged. Violent strokes. He rambled about her voice, her needs. I could see his insanity bleeding through every word. But he was my brother. I thought I could help him."

Owen understood. Family loyalty made you believe impossible things. Made you travel hundreds of miles to meet a ghost. Made you stay in a burning building.

By midday, the fortification was complete. The lobby had transformed into a sealed fortress—furniture barricades at the hallway entrances, wall panels covered with plywood and nails, supplies stacked and organized, weapons arranged within easy reach.

Patricia conducted a final inventory, methodical as always. She reported findings to the group, notebook in hand.

"Food: forty-three cans total—soup, vegetables, fruit. Dried goods, crackers, preserved items. Carefully rationed, that's five full days for six people. Water: unlimited supply, we can melt snow. Firewood: current stockpile will last approximately sixty hours of continuous burning. Heating system is functional at partial capacity thanks to Donnie's repairs, so that extends our fuel supply significantly."

"What about Harold?" Angie asked. "Can we predict him?"

Patricia adjusted her glasses. "Harold is the variable we can't control. But we can predict patterns. He's systematically eliminated our advantages—communication via CB radio, documentation via Mark's camera, partial power. The next logical step in his pattern is direct attack."

"When?" Mark asked, pen poised over his notebook.

"Soon. Weather's cleared—you can see it through the windows. Roads will be plowed within days, maybe hours. Rescue is coming. Harold's window for executing his plan is closing. That makes him more dangerous."

Donnie spoke from his position near the west barricade. "Something I don't understand. Harold's had opportunities to set his fire. Multiple times. He could have ignited the whole building while we slept. Why hasn't he?"

Everyone turned to Eleanor.

She looked small on the couch, wrapped in blankets, frostbitten hands clutched to her chest. "He's waiting for the right moment. Harold talked about... ceremony. About purification ritual. It's not just destruction he wants—it's transcendence. Transformation. He believes when the fire comes, he and the lodge will ascend together. Become one entity."

"That's completely insane," Angie said.

"Yes." Eleanor met her eyes. "Complete, irreversible insanity. Harold doesn't see himself as committing murder-suicide. He sees it as liberation. Freeing the lodge from our corruption. Freeing himself from the prison of flesh."

Silence settled over the group, heavy and oppressive.

Owen moved to the center of the lobby, looked at the boarded walls, the barricaded hallways, his exhausted companions. They'd done everything possible to prepare. Built their fortress. Organized supplies. Armed themselves.

But was it enough against a madman who believed he was enacting divine will?

"We should try talking to him," Mark suggested quietly. "One more time. Before it comes to violence."

"He's beyond talking," Donnie said. "You heard Eleanor. He's delusional."

"Maybe. But we should exhaust peaceful options first. Try reasoning with him."

"I'll try," Owen said.

He walked to the edge of the main barricade, looked into the dark hallway beyond. Somewhere in those shadows, in the passages threading through the walls, Harold lived and watched and plotted.

Owen raised his voice, projecting into the darkness.

"Uncle Harold! I know you can hear me. It's Owen—your nephew. James's son."

Silence answered. Just the wind outside and the fire crackling behind him.

"I've been thinking about what happened to you. About 1960. About the competency hearing. What my father did to you." Owen chose his words carefully. "It was wrong. I can see that now. He stole from you. Took what you built, what you loved. You deserved better."

Still nothing. But Owen felt it—the presence. The sense of being watched. Harold was listening.

"But this..." Owen gestured at the damaged lodge around them. "This doesn't fix it. Burning the place down, hurting people—it won't undo what happened. It won't make you whole again. There are other ways. Legal ways. We can help you fight for justice."

Long silence. Owen was about to continue when a sound stopped him.

Scraping. Metal on wood. Coming from somewhere above and to the left. Moving slowly, deliberately.

Harold's voice echoed from the walls. Impossible to pinpoint.

"You don't understand. None of you understand."

Owen's pulse quickened. "Then help me understand."

"She speaks to me." Harold's voice cracked. "Every night. The lodge. My creation. She tells me things."

"Harold—"

"She's alive!" The shout made everyone jump. "As alive as you! She has a heart, a soul! She remembers when I built her, when I bled for her!"

"What does she tell you?"

"The truth." Harold's voice shifted locations. "She shows me your plans. You want to murder her. Tear her down."

"It's just business—"

"She's not a building!" Raw, primal. "She's my wife! My child! My god! Everything I am exists in her walls!"

"Harold," Owen tried again. "You need help. Medical help. We can get you doctors."

Laughter answered. High-pitched, broken.

"Help?" Harold's voice came from behind the boarded wall. "Put me in a hospital? Drug me into silence?"

"To make you well—"

"I am well! I'm the only one who's well! I see truth! You're all blind, corrupt! You don't deserve her!"

Owen felt control slipping. "We can leave. Tonight. Walk out, leave the lodge standing. You can have it."

Silence. For a moment, Owen thought he'd found the key.

Then Harold whispered, voice somehow carrying through walls.

"Too late. You've contaminated her. Your presence—it's poison. She begs me to purify her. To cleanse the corruption with fire."

"Harold, please—"

"Fire purifies. Fire cleanses. When the flames come, she and I will ascend together. Become one. Pure and perfect and free."

"You'll die," Owen said.

"No. I'll transform. Become part of her forever. As spirit. Her eternal guardian."

This was beyond delusion. Harold had constructed a theology with himself as prophet and martyr.

"And us?" Owen asked.

"Witnesses. Some of you might survive to tell the world. To testify to my righteousness."

"Some of us?"

"She'll decide. When fire comes, she'll choose who lives and who becomes part of the purification."

Owen tried once more. "Harold, buildings don't choose. They don't speak. What you're hearing—"

"LIAR!" The shriek split the air. Something slammed against the wall—heavy impact making boards shudder. "Liar! Deceiver! Murderer!"

More impacts. Harold striking walls from inside passages, rage making him violent.

"She told me you'd say that! Told me you'd try to make me doubt! But I won't! I believe! And faith will be rewarded!"

The impacts stopped.

Silence crashed down.

Owen waited, breathing hard. "Harold? Uncle Harold?"

Nothing.

Harold was gone. Or listening in that oppressive silence.

Owen turned back to the group. Met their frightened eyes.

"That went as expected," Donnie said.

"Complete delusion," Patricia said. "Lodge as living entity, fire as transcendence. Classic messianic complex."

"Can we reason with him?" Mark asked.

"No." Eleanor's voice was flat. "When Harold commits, he doesn't waver. Nothing will turn him."

Angie stood, knife in hand. "Then we fight."

Owen looked at their fortress. Barricades. Boarded walls. Weapons.

They'd done everything possible.

Now they could only wait.

Wait for Harold's move.

Wait for the fire.

Outside, gray afternoon light filtered through snow-covered windows. The storm had passed. Roads would be cleared soon.

Rescue was coming.

But would it come in time?

They gathered in the lobby, listening to wind and building sounds.

Waiting.

Somewhere in the walls, Harold waited too.

Planning his ceremony.

Preparing his fire.

The countdown to purification had begun.
