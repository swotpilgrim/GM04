# Chapter 12: Mark's Footage

Evening. Mark sat in his assigned room with what remained of his equipment.

Most of his film had been destroyed by Harold—exposed to light, rendering it useless. But some cassettes survived, protected in waterproof cases. And the film he'd shot before Harold's first attack remained intact in sealed canisters.

Mark had a portable field development kit for emergencies. Chemical baths, a light-tight changing bag, a small viewer for reviewing 16mm film. The process was tedious, required precision, but he'd done it hundreds of times.

He needed to see what he'd captured. Needed to understand when Harold started watching them, what patterns existed, what they'd missed.

Owen joined him. "Need help?"

"Company, mostly." Mark set up the changing bag. "This'll take a while."

They worked in silence. Mark developed the film strip by strip, using the chemical baths with practiced efficiency. Each strip emerged from the developer showing shadowy images—reversed tonally until fixed and dried.

After two hours, Mark had recovered footage from the first two days—arrival, winterization work, the storm hitting. He loaded the first strip into his portable viewer, a handheld device with a small screen and hand-crank advance.

"Let's see what we caught," Mark said.

Owen pulled a chair beside him. They watched together, Mark narrating what should appear on screen.

The first footage showed the Bronco climbing the mountain road from Chapter 1. Trees passing, elevation markers, snow beginning to fall. Standard B-roll establishing shots, nothing unusual. Mark's narration on the audio track talked about dying American dreams and the end of family enterprises.

Then the lodge exterior. Mark had filmed the building from multiple angles during arrival—panning across its deteriorating grandeur, zooming in on empty windows, wide shots emphasizing the isolation and the mountains beyond.

"There," Owen said. "Stop. Go back a frame."

Mark paused the film, reversed the hand-crank carefully. In one window on the second floor—Room 19, Owen recognized the position—barely visible in the grainy 16mm footage, a shape moved. Human-shaped, thin, withdrawing from the glass the moment Mark's camera panned toward it.

The figure was there for perhaps three frames, less than a fifth of a second of real-time. But undeniable.

"That's Harold," Owen said. "He was watching us arrive. Saw us coming up the road, positioned himself to observe."

Mark made a note on his pad: "Harold visible, arrival day, 3:47 PM timestamp, 2nd floor east wing, Room 19 window. Duration: 3 frames."

He continued cranking through footage. More arrival shots—unloading supplies from the Bronco, Donnie's pickup pulling in, the group entering the main lodge entrance. Mark had captured atmospheric details: their breath visible in the cold air, the way snow had already accumulated on the vehicles, the darkening sky promising worse weather.

In the background of a shot showing Patricia checking her clipboard near the registration desk, barely visible in a shadowy doorway leading to the staff quarters, a figure stood. Gaunt, still, observing. The figure was positioned perfectly to watch without being in direct line of sight—someone unfamiliar with the lodge wouldn't even notice the doorway, let alone see the shadow within it.

"He's in this shot too," Mark said. "Look at the positioning. He's using architectural knowledge to stay hidden in plain sight. I didn't see him when I was filming. He must have been incredibly still, controlled his breathing, waited for me to pan away."

They found Harold in three more arrival-day shots, each one showing increasing sophistication in his surveillance techniques. Always in shadow, always at the periphery of the frame, always watching with predatory patience.

In one shot—Mark filming the lobby's fireplace—Harold was visible for six frames in the background, standing in the hallway that led to the second floor. Completely still. Owen counted: six frames at 24 frames per second meant Harold held that position for a quarter-second while Mark's camera was pointed directly at him, gambling that Mark wouldn't notice the distant figure in low light.

He'd been right. Mark hadn't noticed during filming. Only now, reviewing frame by frame, did Harold's presence reveal itself.

"Patient reconnaissance," Owen said. "He wasn't just watching. He was studying us. Learning our movements, our focus patterns, what we paid attention to and what we ignored."

"Like a hunter studying prey," Mark agreed.

Mark switched to footage from the winterization day—Chapter 2. He'd captured Angie working in the kitchen, Donnie checking heating systems, Owen boarding windows.

Nothing unusual at first. Then, in footage of the empty second-floor hallway that Mark had shot as atmospheric B-roll, Harold appeared.

Walking. Not hiding this time, but moving purposefully down the hall as if he owned it. Checking doors, touching walls, pausing to listen. Then disappearing into a wall panel that seemed solid until Harold pushed it open.

"That's the east wing passage entrance," Owen noted. "We didn't find that panel until days later."

"He was moving freely while we worked," Mark said. "Completely comfortable. This is his home. We're the intruders."

The footage continued. Mark had set up his camera on a tripod in the lobby overnight—Chapter 3, the first night trapped. He'd intended to capture time-lapse footage of the fireplace, create atmospheric shots for his documentary.

What he captured instead made Owen's blood run cold.

The timestamp read 3:47 AM.

The lobby was dark except for dying firelight. Mark and the others were visible sleeping on couches and chairs—completely vulnerable, completely unaware.

From the hallway entrance, Harold emerged.

He moved with eerie silence, bare feet making no sound on the carpet. His skeletal frame seemed to float more than walk. Wild hair fell past his shoulders. He wore layers of filthy clothing—guest bathrobes, stolen shirts, things scavenged over years.

Harold approached the couch where Mark slept.

Stood over him.

For ninety full seconds—Mark counted them, horrified—Harold stared down at his sleeping form. No movement. Just watching. Studying. His face visible in the firelight showed intelligence and madness mixed. Eyes bright, lips moving as if talking to himself.

Then Harold reached out. His hand—gnarled, fingernails long and dirty—touched Mark's camera gently. Almost tenderly. Stroked the lens as one might pet a beloved object.

Harold whispered something. Inaudible on the silent 16mm film, but his lips formed words.

Then he withdrew. Glided back to the hallway. Disappeared.

Mark sat frozen, watching his near-death on screen.

"He could have killed me," Mark said hoarsely. "Slit my throat, smothered me, any number of ways. Why didn't he?"

Owen's mind raced through possibilities. "You weren't a threat yet. You were documenting, which Harold might have seen as... bearing witness? He talks about needing witnesses to his justice. Maybe your camera serves his purpose."

"Or maybe he's just insane enough to be unpredictable."

"That too."

Mark continued reviewing footage, though his hands shook now. More shots from subsequent days. Harold visible in several—always in background, always watching.

But one shot stopped them both.

Arrival day, Chapter 1. Mark had been filming Owen giving an interview about the lodge's closure. The audio was captured separately on Mark's cassette recorder, but the visual showed Owen standing in the lobby, talking to the camera.

Mark rewound to the specific moment, showed Owen the frame.

Owen was saying: "This is the last trip. We're selling to developers. The whole thing gets demolished in spring."

In the background, barely visible through a distant doorway, Harold stood watching.

His body language changed the moment Owen said "demolished." Went rigid. Hands clenched.

Then Harold turned and disappeared.

"That's when he decided," Mark said. "That's when Harold committed to his endgame. He heard you say the lodge would be torn down, and something broke in him. Final break."

Owen replayed the moment, watching Harold's reaction. Before that statement, Harold had been merely observing. After it, his entire posture changed—from watcher to hunter.

"I triggered him," Owen said quietly. "My words made him escalate."

"You didn't know he was there."

"Doesn't matter. He heard me say I'd destroy his creation. From his perspective, I declared war on the thing he loves most." Owen sat back. "That's why Eleanor appeared when she did. Why the attacks intensified. He went from patient sabotage to active murder because I said we'd demolish the lodge."

Mark saved that footage, marked it as evidence.

They continued through the remaining reels. Each one showed more of Harold—his movements, his patterns, his obsessive surveillance.

The final usable footage was from the morning they'd discovered Eleanor—Chapter 4. Mark had been filming the snow-blocked windows, the building's isolation.

In reflection on the glass, barely visible: Harold's face. Watching Mark film. So close that Harold's breath had fogged the window.

Mark stopped the viewer.

"He's always been right there," Mark said. "Inches away. We thought we were alone, thought we were in control. But Harold's been present for every conversation, every plan, every moment of fear. He knows us better than we know ourselves."

Owen thought about the character analyses they'd found in Harold's nest. Accurate descriptions of each person's weaknesses and behaviors. Harold had studied them like a scientist studies specimens.

"We need to show this to the others," Owen said.

They gathered the group, showed them the key footage. Patricia took notes on Harold's movements, mapping his patterns. Donnie studied how Harold used the passages, looking for defensive strategies. Angie watched the 3:47 AM footage with growing horror.

Eleanor wept seeing her brother on screen—recognizing him despite the deterioration, seeing what he'd become.

"That's Harold," she confirmed. "The way he moves, the way he tilts his head when thinking. That's my brother."

"He's been living like this for eight years," Patricia said. "Watching guests, watching staff, watching the family. Building intelligence, planning revenge."

"And we triggered the final stage," Owen added, showing them the demolition-statement footage. "I told him his creation would be destroyed. From that moment, he committed to killing us."

The group absorbed the evidence in silence.

"At least we know his timeline now," Donnie said. "He told us himself in the passages: 'Tomorrow the cleansing.' Storm's breaking tonight. Tomorrow he strikes."

"Then we have tonight to prepare," Owen said. "One night to fortify, to plan, to get ready for Harold's attack."

"Can we stop him?" Angie asked.

Owen looked at the final frozen frame on Mark's viewer: Harold's face reflected in glass, staring directly at the camera with eyes that held no mercy.

"We have to," Owen said.

Because the alternative was dying in flames, trapped in a burning lodge while Harold laughed in the walls.

Tomorrow would bring the confrontation.

Tonight, they prepared.

The endgame had arrived.
