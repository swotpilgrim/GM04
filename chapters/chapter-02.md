# Chapter 2: Winterizing

Donnie woke to pipes groaning in the walls.

He'd slept in the basement maintenance room, close to the heating system. The concrete floor was cold even through his sleeping bag. His watch read 6:47 AM. Outside, through the high basement window, early light filtered through pines.

The heating system clanked and hissed—alive, but complaining. Donnie approached the boiler, studying pressure gauges. Everything within acceptable range, barely. This whole lodge was held together with rust and stubbornness.

He lit a cigarette and climbed the basement stairs to the main floor.

The lobby was empty, cold despite the heating system's efforts. Donnie headed for the kitchen, following the smell of coffee. Angie stood at the industrial sink, running water over her hands.

"Morning," Donnie grunted.

"Coffee's on the counter," Angie said without turning around. "Powdered creamer, no milk. Sugar if you want diabetes."

Donnie poured himself a cup from the camping percolator. The coffee tasted like burned dirt, but it was hot. "How'd you sleep?"

"I didn't." Angie dried her hands on a towel. "This place makes noise all night. Creaking, settling. Like it's breathing."

"Old buildings do that."

"I know what old buildings do." She turned to face him, dark circles under her eyes. "This felt different."

Donnie didn't have an answer for that, so he drank his coffee.

Owen appeared in the doorway, looking as tired as Angie. Patricia followed, dressed in layers against the cold, her wire-rim glasses slightly fogged from the temperature change.

"We should start early," Owen said. "Donnie, you were right about the storm. Radio says it's moving faster than predicted."

"Told you." Donnie stubbed out his cigarette. "My knees never lie."

Mark stumbled in last, hair sticking up at odd angles, camera bag over his shoulder even at this hour. "What's the plan?"

Owen laid out the work: he and Donnie would drain pipes in the guest wings, board up windows on the north face, shut down unnecessary heating zones. Patricia would inventory furniture and equipment for auction. Angie would prep the kitchen for final shutdown. Mark could film the process.

"I prefer 'document,'" Mark said.

By eight AM, Owen and Donnie were on the second floor with toolboxes.

"Start with the east wing," Donnie said, kneeling beside a radiator. "These pipes are the oldest. Drain them first, work our way back."

Owen held the bucket while Donnie opened the valve. Brown water sputtered out, smelling of rust and minerals. They worked in silence, moving from room to room, the building creaking around them.

In Room 15, Owen noticed the window was already boarded from inside.

"You do this?" he asked.

Donnie looked up from the radiator. "No. Must've been your dad, last season."

But Owen didn't remember his father boarding windows. They'd always done it together, final task before closing for winter. He ran his hand over the boards—fresh nails, clean cuts. Recent work.

"Weird," Owen muttered.

"What?"

"Nothing." Owen held the bucket steady as more water drained.

They moved to Room 17. The door was locked. Owen tried his key ring, found the right key, opened it. Inside, the room looked normal—stripped bed, empty drawers, curtains drawn. But something felt wrong. Owen couldn't place it until Donnie spoke.

"Someone's been in here."

Owen followed Donnie's gaze to the floor. Footprints in the dust—recent, adult-sized, leading from the door to the window and back. Not their footprints. Someone else.

"Probably from last season," Owen said, not believing it.

"Your dad the only one with keys?"

"And me. And now you all." Owen studied the prints. They were large, larger than his own feet. Work boots, maybe. The tread pattern was worn smooth. "Could be from maintenance last fall."

"Could be." Donnie didn't sound convinced.

They finished the east wing by ten-thirty, moved to the west wing. The work was repetitive, mind-numbing—drain radiator, seal valve, board window, move to next room. Owen's hands grew numb despite his gloves.

On the third floor, Donnie's wrench disappeared.

"The hell?" Donnie stood up, looking around Room 34. "I set it right there on the windowsill. Right there."

Owen helped him search. They checked the hallway, the adjacent rooms, retraced their steps. The wrench was gone. Eventually they found it two rooms over, lying in the middle of the floor of Room 36—a room they hadn't entered yet.

"I didn't—" Donnie started, then stopped. "I didn't move it."

"Maybe you're tired. It's easy to forget—"

"I didn't forget." Donnie's jaw clenched. "I set it on the windowsill in 34. I remember clear as day."

Owen had no explanation. They went back to work, but Donnie kept glancing over his shoulder.

In the office, Patricia worked through filing cabinets.

Financial records going back decades—purchase orders, maintenance logs, insurance claims. The numbers told a story of slow decay. Revenue dropping year over year, expenses climbing, insurance premiums astronomical after each incident.

And there were a lot of incidents.

Patricia pulled a folder labeled "Insurance Claims 1970-1975." Inside: seven fire damage claims, twelve equipment failures, five guest injuries. Another folder: "Claims 1976-1980." More of the same. Kitchen fires, electrical fires, broken heating, collapsed railings, food poisoning.

Owen's father had fought this battle for decades, never winning.

Patricia heard footsteps in the hallway and looked up. Nobody there. The building settling, probably. She returned to the files.

Something bothered her about the pattern of claims. They were too regular—one major incident every few months, like clockwork. Random accidents shouldn't have such consistent timing. She pulled out her calculator, started mapping incidents to a timeline.

A crash from the lobby made her jump. She stood, walked to the doorway. "Hello?"

No answer. Patricia crossed to the lobby and found a picture frame face-down on the floor, glass shattered. It had been hanging on the wall—a photo of the lodge's opening night in 1951. The nail was still in the wall. The frame must have fallen.

Except the nail looked fine. Not bent, not loose.

Patricia hung the frame back up, carefully. It held. She stood back, watching it for a moment, then returned to the office.

The timeline would have to wait.

Angie attacked the kitchen like it had personally insulted her.

She started with the walk-in freezer, checking seals and cataloging contents. Mostly empty except for some frozen vegetables from last season, frost-covered and forgotten. The freezer motor hummed steadily. At least something in this building worked properly.

She moved to the prep stations, industrial stoves, the dishwasher that could process fifty plates at once. Most of it was salvageable for auction. Some wasn't worth hauling away.

The pantry was locked, as she'd mentioned yesterday. Angie used the key from the office board, opened it. Inside were wire shelves lined with canned goods, dried foods, commercial-size containers of spices and flour.

But yesterday, she'd found this pantry nearly empty.

Now there were at least a dozen cans on the shelves. Soup, vegetables, fruit. And jerky, sealed packages of it. Crackers in wax paper.

Angie stared at the shelves, then at her notes from yesterday's inventory. She'd documented three cans of soup, some flour. That was it.

Unless she'd missed them. Maybe they were pushed to the back, and she hadn't seen them in the dim light.

She grabbed the nearest can—tomato soup—and checked the label. Expiration date: March 1981. Still good. But where had it come from?

"Hey!" she called out. "Donnie!"

No answer. They were working on the upper floors.

Angie made a note on her inventory sheet, circled it twice, and continued cataloging.

Mark filmed everything.

He captured Owen and Donnie working in silence, their breath visible in cold rooms. Patricia bent over files, pencil scratching paper. Angie in the kitchen, scowling at industrial equipment.

He filmed the building itself—water-stained ceilings, peeling wallpaper, the lobby's fireplace with cold ashes. The decay was beautiful, tragic and honest.

Around noon, Mark set up his camera on a tripod in the second-floor hallway, let it run on time-lapse while he went to lunch. When he returned, he checked the footage.

Empty hallway. Nothing moving. Then, briefly, a shadow crossed the frame at the far end. Gone too quickly to identify.

Probably Donnie or Owen.

Mark moved to the third floor for different angles.

That evening, he reviewed his audio cassettes in his room, headphones on, listening to ambient sound he'd captured throughout the day. Mostly what he expected—footsteps, distant voices, building sounds. But in one recording from the second floor, underneath his own narration about "architectural decay," there was something else.

Breathing. Faint but distinct, a rhythm that didn't match his own.

And scraping. Like something being dragged across wood.

Mark rewound the tape, listened again. Still there. He checked his notes—he'd been alone in that hallway when he recorded this.

Equipment malfunction, probably. Cheap cassette recorder picking up interference.

He made a note to mention it to Donnie anyway, in case there were rats in the walls.

At four PM, the weather report came through on the AM radio.

Everyone gathered as the tinny voice announced the storm's new timeline: major system moving faster than anticipated, arriving by midnight instead of tomorrow afternoon. Heavy snow, high winds, roads impassable.

"We should leave," Angie said. "Now, get ahead of it."

Owen shook his head. "We're halfway through winterization. One more day."

"One more day and we're trapped."

"Better trapped here than caught on the mountain road in a blizzard."

Donnie sided with Owen. "Road down the mountain is forty miles of switchbacks. Storm catches us halfway, we're dead. Better to stay, finish the work, leave when it passes."

Patricia did the math. "If the storm lasts two days, we have enough supplies for five days total. We'll be fine."

"Unless the heating system fails," Donnie added. "Then we freeze."

"Comforting," Mark muttered.

Angie looked at Owen, jaw tight. "This is a mistake."

"Probably." Owen met her eyes. "But we're staying."

Nobody argued. They ate dinner in shifts, grabbed what sleep they could. The plan was to work through the night, finish before the storm hit.

By eight PM, Owen was boarding up ground-floor windows, hammer in numb hands, nails between his teeth. The wind had picked up, carrying the smell of snow.

Inside, Donnie drained the last radiators. Patricia finished her inventory. Angie locked the pantry—after removing the mysterious extra cans.

Mark set up his camera to record overnight in the lobby, hoping to catch more time-lapse footage.

Nobody noticed when, around nine PM, the key to Room 9 went missing from the office board.

Nobody saw the figure moving through the walls, watching them work, counting down to the moment when the storm would seal them all inside.

By midnight, snow began to fall.

In the darkness between the walls, Harold Reeves waited.
