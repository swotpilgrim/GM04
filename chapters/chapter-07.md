# Chapter 7: Evidence

Morning brought gray light and exhaustion.

Owen stood at the lobby windows, watching snow fall. The storm showed no signs of breaking. Day three trapped, at least two more days before rescue.

Two more days with Harold in the walls.

Behind him, the group stirred. Angie made coffee. Donnie checked the fire. Mark reviewed cassette recordings. Eleanor slept on, color better but still mostly unconscious.

Patricia appeared at Owen's elbow, clipboard in hand.

"We need to understand this," she said. "If Harold's been sabotaging the lodge, there has to be evidence. A pattern."

"Where do we look?"

"Your father's records. Operations, maintenance, incidents. If we map it out, we might understand what Harold's been doing."

"The office," Owen said. "Filing cabinets going back to 1951."

"Let's start there."

---

The office was cold. Owen unlocked the cabinets while Patricia set up at the desk.

They started with incident reports.

Owen pulled files: insurance claims, maintenance logs, accident reports. Decades of documentation by his father—a man who'd never understood why his business kept failing.

Patricia took each file, extracted key information, marked her timeline.

1960: Kitchen fire. Electrical fire in Room 23. Broken heating.

1961: Guest injured by collapsing railing. Food poisoning. Burst pipe.

1962: Another kitchen fire. Equipment failures. Vandalism.

The pattern continued. Regular incidents every few months. Insurance claims mounted. Costs escalated. Revenue dropped.

After two hours, Patricia sat back.

"Look at this."

She'd created a timeline, incidents marked in red across forty years.

"Sixty-three documented incidents from 1960 to 1980. Fires, equipment failures, injuries, vandalism. Three to four per year."

"That's a lot."

"Too many. Random accidents don't cluster like this." She pointed to marks. "August 1960—fire one month after Harold's buyout. June 1963—incidents during your father's wedding. September 1968—failures the month you were born. And every October since 1972—"

"The month Harold disappeared."

"Every October, a major incident. Like clockwork. Kitchen fire, electrical failure, burst pipes. Every October without fail."

Owen studied the timeline, stomach sinking. "Harold did this."

"All of it." Patricia pulled another file. "Look at the financial impact. Each incident drove up premiums. Each accident cost money. Each injury led to lawsuits. Your father was bankrupted slowly, over decades, by what he thought was bad luck."

"It was murder," Owen said quietly. "Of a business. Of my father's life."

"Harold destroyed him deliberately. For forty years."

Owen sat, the weight settling on him. His father had died two years ago, exhausted, broken, never knowing his own brother had sabotaged everything.

"We need to show the others," Patricia said.

---

They gathered in the lobby. Patricia presented her timeline, explaining the pattern, the deliberate targeting, the financial destruction.

Donnie studied the documents, his face grim. "This is sick."

"This is revenge," Angie corrected. "Harold felt wronged, so he spent forty years destroying his brother's life."

Mark filmed the timeline, capturing the evidence. "And now he's here. Trapped with us. What does he want?"

"The lodge is being sold," Owen said. "Demolished. His creation destroyed forever. Maybe he wants to stop it. Maybe he wants witnesses to his 'justice.'"

"Or maybe he just wants revenge on the family that betrayed him," Patricia said.

Eleanor stirred on the couch. Her eyes opened. "Water?"

Angie brought her a cup. Eleanor drank slowly, hands trembling. The frostbite looked worse in daylight—blackened, swollen. But she was alert.

"How long have I been here?"

"Three days since we found you," Patricia said. "We don't know how long before that."

Eleanor's face clouded. "Days. Maybe a week. Everything blurs."

Owen knelt beside her. "You said Harold lured you here. Tell us everything."

Eleanor nodded weakly. "Six months ago—May, I think—I received a letter. Return address in this town, but no name. Inside was a letter from Harold." She paused, gathering strength. "I thought it was a cruel joke. Harold died in 1972. Everyone said so."

"What did the letter say?"

"That he'd been here all along. Living in the lodge, hiding from the family that wronged him. He said he had proof—documents showing your father forged the competency hearing, stole Harold's share illegally. He begged me to come see the evidence, to witness what had been done to him."

"You believed him?" Angie asked.

"Not at first. But he sent more letters. Three more over the summer. Each more desperate. And then photos—polaroids of himself, holding recent newspapers, standing in this lobby. He was alive. Gaunt, wild-looking, but definitely him."

Patricia made notes. "So you came."

"I arrived three days before you did. Stayed in a motel in town. Harold called me there—" She paused. "How did he even get to a phone?"

"There's a payphone in town," Donnie said. "Twelve-mile hike. Hard, but possible."

Eleanor continued. "He told me to come to the lodge at midnight. He'd unlock the basement window. I should wait in Room 9."

"And you went," Owen said.

"I wanted to help him. He was my brother. I thought..." Eleanor's voice broke. "I thought I could reason with him, get him help. But when he appeared, I knew immediately—he's not the Harold I remembered. Something broke in him. He ranted about the lodge being alive, speaking to him, telling him secrets. He showed me plans, scribbled notes, decades of documentation about his sabotage. He was proud of it. Proud of destroying James's life."

"My father," Owen said.

"I tried to leave. Harold locked the door, took my coat and car keys. Said I'd betrayed him just like the rest of the family, that I needed to stay and witness his 'final act.' He left me there. No food, no heat. I could hear him moving in the walls, talking to himself, laughing." Eleanor closed her eyes. "I thought I was going to die in that room."

Mark spoke up. "What's the final act? What's Harold planning?"

"He talked about cleansing. About fire. About the lodge being sold to developers who'd tear her down—he always called the building 'her,' like she was a person. He said if he couldn't have her, no one could." Eleanor looked at Owen. "I think he plans to burn the lodge down. With all of you inside."

Silence.

"When?" Donnie asked.

"I don't know. Soon. He said the sale was the end, that your presence here was providence, that the family needed to suffer for what they'd done."

Owen stood, walked to the windows. Fire. Harold planned to burn down Timberline with them trapped inside.

"We need to find his nest," Donnie said. "Where he's been living. His supplies, his plans, his accelerants. If we can destroy those, we might prevent the fire."

"He knows we're looking now," Patricia countered. "He'll be more careful."

"Then we search faster. Methodically." Donnie was already moving. "I'm checking every crawlspace I can find."

---

Donnie, Owen, and Mark began a systematic search of the building's hidden spaces.

They started with the wall panel from last night. Donnie entered first, flashlight between his teeth, crawling into the narrow passage. Owen followed, Mark behind him with his portable cassette recorder capturing audio.

The passage was cramped—barely two feet wide, filled with pipes and electrical conduits. Dust covered everything. The smell was awful: mildew, sweat, decay.

They found caches.

In an alcove behind the east wing: bundled blankets, filthy and old. Empty food cans, labels from different decades—1960s soup cans, 1970s vegetables, recent crackers. Water containers. A kerosene heater, small and portable.

Evidence of long-term habitation.

"He's been living like this for eight years," Owen said, horrified.

Donnie examined the setup. "Moving between different caches, never staying in one place too long. Smart, if you're trying to avoid detection."

They moved deeper. The passage connected to a vertical shaft—pipes running between floors. Donnie shined his light up.

"This goes all the way to the attic," he said. "He can move between floors using these shafts."

They climbed—handholds on the pipes, precarious and dangerous. Emerged on the second floor in a different passage. Found another cache: more supplies, more evidence.

On the third floor, they discovered the entrance to the attic crawlspace.

A storage closet had a false ceiling panel. Donnie climbed through, Owen following.

The attic space was larger—three feet high, extending across the entire east wing. Enough room to crouch-walk, to move freely if you didn't mind being bent over.

And there, in the far corner: Harold's nest.

A sleeping pallet made of stolen guest linens. The kerosene heater they'd found evidence of downstairs. Food containers, empty and stacked. Clothing, layered and filthy.

But most disturbing: the walls.

Someone had written on the exposed beams, the ceiling joists, every surface. Same words, repeated thousands of times in different sizes:

THE LODGE IS MINE
THE LODGE IS MINE
THE LODGE IS MINE

And beneath that, scratched with something sharp:

FIRE CLEANSES
THEY MUST BURN
SHE TELLS ME TO DO IT

"Jesus Christ," Owen breathed.

Mark captured it all on audio, his voice shaking as he described what they were seeing.

Donnie found architectural drawings pinned to a beam—the original plans for Timberline, marked in red ink showing every hidden passage, every crawlspace, every secret space only the builder would know.

"He's been preparing for this for years," Donnie said.

Owen found something else: photographs. Dozens of them, scattered across the pallet. His father, younger, working at the lodge. His mother. Owen himself as a child. All with red X's marked across the faces.

And recent photos—the crew arriving three days ago. Candid shots taken from hiding. Owen unloading supplies. Patricia in the office. Angie in the kitchen.

Harold had been watching them from the start.

"We need to leave," Mark said. "Right now. Hike out through the storm, risk freezing, anything's better than staying here."

"We'd die in an hour," Donnie said. "Temperature's below zero. Wind chill is deadly. Storm's not over."

"So we're trapped."

"Yeah." Donnie studied the writings on the walls. "We're trapped with a man who's spent eight years going insane, who plans to burn us alive."

They climbed back down to the lobby, brought Eleanor and the women to see what they'd found.

Patricia documented everything in her notes. Angie stood silent, face pale. Eleanor wept quietly, seeing what her brother had become.

"This is my fault," Eleanor said. "I should have gone to the police when he first contacted me. I thought I could help him, but I just walked into his trap."

"You're a victim too," Patricia said gently.

Owen stood in the center of the lobby, surrounded by evidence of Harold's forty years of madness and revenge.

His uncle was in the building, planning mass murder, and there was no way out.

The mystery was solved. They knew who, they knew why, they knew what was coming.

But knowing didn't mean they could stop it.

The hunt was on.

And they were the prey.
