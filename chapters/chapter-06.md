# Chapter 6: First Night

Nobody slept.

They stayed together in the lobby, fire burning high, Eleanor unconscious near the hearth. The couches and chairs had been arranged in a rough circle facing outward, defensive positions. Flashlights and improvised weapons—fireplace poker, Donnie's wrench, kitchen knives—sat within easy reach.

Owen stood by the windows, watching snow pile higher against the glass. Behind him, the group spoke in low voices.

"Tell me about the passages," Owen said to Donnie.

Donnie lit another cigarette, his fourth in an hour. "Crawlspaces. Access for pipes, electrical wiring, HVAC ducts. Standard for commercial buildings this size."

"How extensive?"

"Enough to reach most of the building. But they're not designed for people. Tight spaces, two feet wide at most. You'd have to crouch or crawl." Donnie exhaled smoke. "No way someone's been living in them for eight years."

"Eleanor said Harold designed them himself."

"Then maybe he made them bigger than standard. I don't know the building like he did. I just maintain what's already here."

Patricia looked up from her notes. "Could someone navigate through them? Move between floors?"

"Theoretically. There are vertical shafts for pipes. If you knew the layout well enough..." Donnie trailed off. "Yeah. I guess you could."

Mark sat forward, camera in his lap. "We should explore them. Map them out."

"Absolutely not," Angie said immediately.

"But if Harold's in there—"

"Then he knows them better than we do. Going in would be suicide." Angie wrapped her arms around herself. "We stay in open areas. Together. Where we can see threats coming."

"I agree with Angie," Owen said. "We don't know what we're dealing with. Could be Harold, could be someone else, could be more than one person. Until we have more information, we don't go into those passages."

Mark looked disappointed but nodded.

"We need watch shifts," Patricia suggested. "Two people awake at all times. The rest sleep as best we can. We can't stay alert indefinitely."

They divided the night into three-hour shifts. Patricia and Owen would take first watch. Mark and Angie second. Donnie would take third alone—he insisted he'd spent enough nights in this building to be comfortable solo.

The first shift passed quietly. Patricia sat near the fire, reading through financial files by flashlight. Owen paced, checking windows and doors, listening to the building settle around them.

Around eleven PM, Eleanor stirred. Her eyes opened briefly, unfocused and confused, then closed again. Her breathing remained steady. Whatever physical trauma she'd suffered, her body was fighting through it.

Midnight came. Owen woke Mark and Angie for second shift, then settled onto a couch near the fire. He closed his eyes, tried to sleep.

The building creaked around him. Wind howled. Somewhere in the walls, pipes groaned and hissed.

Sleep felt impossible. But exhaustion pulled him under anyway.

---

Patricia's 2 AM shift started quiet.

Mark had dozed off in his chair despite being on watch. Patricia didn't wake him—he looked exhausted, dark circles under his eyes. She sat alone by the dying fire, adding logs to keep it burning, watching shadows dance across the lobby walls.

The building made noises. It always did. Old structures settled, wood expanded and contracted with temperature changes, pipes carried hot water through cold spaces. Normal sounds.

But then she heard something different.

Scraping. Behind the wall to her left. Like something being dragged across wood.

Patricia froze, listening.

The scraping stopped. Silence. Then soft footsteps on the floor above.

Not the random settling of an old building. Deliberate. Rhythmic. Someone walking.

Patricia stood slowly, moved to where Owen slept on the couch. She touched his shoulder.

His eyes opened instantly. "What?"

"Listen."

They stood together in the dim firelight. Above them, the footsteps continued. Pacing back and forth, directly overhead. Ten steps one direction, pause, ten steps back.

Owen looked at the ceiling. "That's the second floor hallway."

The footsteps stopped.

Complete silence.

Patricia's heart hammered. She could hear her own breathing, hear the fire crackling, hear—

The footsteps started again. Faster now. Moving toward the stairs.

"Wake everyone," Owen whispered.

Patricia moved quickly, shaking Angie awake, then Mark, then Donnie. They scrambled up, grabbing weapons, fully alert in seconds.

The footsteps reached the top of the stairs. Paused.

Owen stepped toward the stairwell, fireplace poker raised. "Who's there?"

Silence.

"This is my building. Show yourself."

Nothing.

Then, drifting down from the second floor, a sound that froze Owen's blood.

Laughter. High-pitched, childlike, utterly wrong. A giggle that went on too long, breaking into silence.

"What the fuck was that?" Angie breathed.

Donnie already had his flashlight out, wrench in his other hand. "I'm checking."

"We go together," Owen said.

Five of them moved toward the stairs—Owen leading, Donnie behind him, Mark filming out of instinct, Angie and Patricia at the rear. Eleanor remained unconscious on the couch, alone in the firelit lobby.

They climbed to the second floor.

The hallway was dark, doors closed. Owen swept his flashlight across walls and ceiling. Nothing moved. No sounds except their own breathing and footsteps.

"Check the rooms," Owen ordered.

They moved down the hallway methodically. Owen tried the first door—Room 10. Locked, as they'd left it. He unlocked it, pushed it open. Empty. Bed bare, curtains drawn, dust undisturbed.

They checked Room 11. Locked. Empty.

Room 12. Locked. Empty.

Room 13. The door swung open at Owen's touch.

He stopped. "This was locked."

"You sure?" Donnie asked.

"Positive. I locked it myself this afternoon."

They entered cautiously. The room looked normal—bare mattress, empty dresser, closed curtains. Owen checked the closet. Nothing.

They moved to Room 14. Also unlocked. And Room 15. Three doors they'd definitely locked were now standing open.

"Someone's been here," Patricia said quietly.

Mark panned his camera across the hallway. "Or something."

They continued checking. At the far end of the hallway, near the east wing, Owen found Mark's film bag. It had been in Mark's room on the first floor.

Now it sat in the middle of the second-floor hallway, contents scattered.

Cassette tapes unwound into tangled messes. Film canisters opened, exposing film to light. Notes torn and scattered.

"My equipment," Mark breathed. "That's all my backup footage."

"How did it get up here?" Angie looked around wildly. "How?"

No one had an answer.

Donnie walked to the wall panel they'd found earlier—the hidden passage entrance. He pressed on the seam. The panel opened slightly. He pulled it wider, shined his flashlight inside.

The passage was empty. Dust on the floor showed footprints leading in both directions—but they were impossible to follow in the cramped space.

A smell wafted out. Stronger now than before. Human occupation. Sweat, waste, old food.

Something lived in these walls.

Donnie slammed the panel shut.

"We need to check the rest of the floor," Owen said.

They spread out, checking every room, every closet, every space large enough to hide a person. All empty. But the evidence was clear—someone had been here, moving through their locked rooms, going through their belongings.

"Kitchen," Angie said suddenly. "If someone's taking film equipment, they might be taking food too."

They descended to the first floor. Angie led them to the kitchen, turned on the camping lantern.

The walk-in freezer door stood ajar.

Angie always locked it to prevent frost buildup. She'd locked it before going to sleep.

Now it hung open six inches.

She pulled it wider, stepped inside. Cold air rolled out. She scanned the shelves, counting inventory in her head.

"Food's missing," she said. "Canned goods. The dried jerky I had in here. Box of crackers."

"How much?" Owen asked.

"Enough for a few days. Survival food, stuff that doesn't need cooking." Angie backed out of the freezer. "Someone's stealing from us."

Patricia marked it in her notebook. "We need to secure the food. Move it all to the lobby where we can watch it."

"And we need to barricade," Donnie added. "Block access to the second floor. Make it harder for whoever's doing this to reach us."

They worked quickly. Dragged heavy furniture across the stairwell entrance—desks, cabinets, anything substantial. Created a choke point that could be watched easily.

Moved all food supplies into the lobby, stacked in a corner near the fire. Water containers, canned goods, everything edible.

Angie armed herself with a kitchen knife, kept it in her belt. Mark salvaged what he could of his equipment—some cassettes might still be usable. Patricia inventoried the stolen food, calculated how it affected their rationing.

Owen stood guard at the barricade, watching the stairs beyond.

By four AM, they'd fortified as best they could.

The lobby was now their stronghold. One entrance, heavily barricaded. Fire burning. Supplies within reach. Weapons ready.

Eleanor slept through all of it, lost in fever dreams.

The group collapsed onto couches and chairs, exhausted but too wired to sleep.

"This is insane," Angie said. "We're barricading ourselves inside a building we own, hiding from someone who's been living in the walls."

"Not someone," Patricia corrected quietly. "Harold. Eleanor identified him."

"A man in his seventies who's been living like a rat for eight years." Angie laughed without humor. "And we're afraid of him."

"You heard that laugh," Mark said. "That wasn't normal. Whatever Harold was, he's not that anymore. He's..." Mark searched for words. "He's broken."

"Broken people are still people," Donnie said. "Which means they bleed, they tire, they can be stopped."

"Can they?" Owen stared into the fire. "He knows this building better than we do. Every passage, every hiding place. He can move through walls while we're stuck in open spaces. How do we fight that?"

No one answered.

Outside, the storm raged. Snow piled higher against the windows, burying them deeper.

Inside, the lodge groaned and settled. Pipes hissed. Wood creaked.

And in the walls—in the darkness behind panels and beneath floors—Harold moved through his domain, planning his next move.

He'd shown them he was here. Shown them he could reach them whenever he wanted. Taken their food, their equipment, their sense of safety.

The game was escalating.

And Harold had all the advantages.

Dawn was still hours away. The night stretched ahead, dark and full of sounds that might be the building settling or might be footsteps approaching.

The group huddled near the fire, weapons close, listening to every creak and groan.

Waiting for morning.

Praying the night would end without more intrusions.

But knowing, deep in their bones, that Harold wasn't done with them yet.

Not even close.
