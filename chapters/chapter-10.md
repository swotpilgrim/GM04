# Chapter 10: Red Herring

Morning of the fourth day brought the first break in weather.

The wind had died down during the night. Snow still fell, but lighter now, gentle flakes instead of driving fury. Through the lobby windows, Owen could see more than just white wall—actual shapes of buried vehicles, the outline of pine trees beyond the parking lot.

The storm was ending.

"Another day, maybe two," Donnie said, standing beside him with coffee. "Then the plows will start. Three days after that, we're out of here."

Three to five days. They'd been trapped for four already. Owen did the math—they could make it. The food would last, the heat was stable, and they'd fortified their position.

If Harold didn't strike first.

Donnie voiced what Owen was thinking. "Question is whether Harold moves before rescue arrives."

"Yeah."

They stood in silence, watching snow fall.

"I've been thinking," Donnie said. "About the whole thing. Harold living in the walls for eight years, sabotaging the lodge, planning revenge."

"And?"

"What if it's not Harold?"

Owen looked at him. "Eleanor identified him."

"Eleanor saw someone gaunt and wild who claimed to be Harold. After eight years and severe trauma, would she recognize her own brother? People change. Especially if they've been living like an animal."

"You think it's someone else?"

"Maybe Harold did die in 1972, like everyone thought. And someone else found his hideouts, his plans, his obsession with the lodge. Vagrant, drifter, someone mentally ill who latched onto Harold's delusion." Donnie lit a cigarette. "Would explain why the sabotage continued after Harold supposedly disappeared. Different person, same methods."

Owen considered it. "The handwriting analysis. Patricia matched sabotage from the 1960s to recent vandalism."

"Handwriting can be copied. If someone found Harold's old journals, his notes, they could imitate his writing."

"Why would they?"

"Why does anyone do crazy shit?" Donnie exhaled smoke. "Mental illness, obsession, wanting to belong to something. This person finds Harold's nest, his plans for destroying the Reeves family, decides to continue the mission."

It was plausible. Owen had to admit that. More plausible than a man surviving eight years in crawlspaces eating stolen canned goods.

"We should check," Owen said.

---

They gathered the group, presented Donnie's theory.

Angie latched onto it immediately. "That makes more sense than Harold being alive. People don't live in walls for eight years."

"Harold designed those walls," Patricia countered. "He knew every passage, every hiding place. If anyone could survive that long, it would be him."

"Or," Donnie said, "someone found his designs and used them. We found architectural drawings in the nest. Anyone could follow those."

Mark looked uncertain. "But the timeline matches. Sabotage started in 1960 when Harold was pushed out, continued through his supposed death in 1972, ongoing to present day."

"Which proves nothing," Donnie argued. "Could be Harold from 1960 to 1972, then someone else after. Or multiple people over the years. Point is, we're assuming it's Harold based on limited evidence."

Eleanor spoke from the couch, stronger now, able to sit up unassisted. "The man I saw was Harold. I know my brother."

"You think you do," Donnie said, not unkindly. "But eight years of starvation, isolation, mental illness—would change anyone beyond recognition. You saw what you expected to see."

"His voice. His mannerisms. The way he talked about the building." Eleanor's hands trembled. "That was Harold."

"Or someone imitating him."

Owen interjected. "There's one way to know for sure. Harold's possessions from 1972—the box we found. Eleanor, you knew Harold before he disappeared. Could you identify something only he would have?"

Eleanor nodded. "His wedding ring. He never took it off, even after his wife died in 1965. Silver band with an inscription inside: 'To HMR from CMR, forever.' His wife's initials."

Patricia stood. "I'll get the box."

She returned minutes later with the cardboard box labeled "H. Reeves - Personal Effects 1972." They spread the contents on a table: journals, photographs, letters, a pocket watch, cufflinks, a worn wallet.

No ring.

"Not here," Patricia said.

"Which proves nothing," Donnie maintained. "Could've lost it, sold it, thrown it away in his mental decline."

"Or," Angie said, "the person who took Harold's identity kept it, because they're actually Harold."

Mark had an idea. "What about dental records? If we find... remains... in the building, we could confirm identity through teeth."

"We haven't found remains," Owen said. "Just evidence of habitation."

"Yet," Mark added darkly.

Patricia pulled her timeline notes. "Let me approach this analytically. If Harold died in 1972, and someone else continued the sabotage, we should see a shift in pattern or methodology. Let me cross-reference the incidents."

She worked while the others watched. Comparing pre-1972 incidents to post-1972. Looking for changes in technique, timing, types of sabotage.

After twenty minutes, she looked up.

"The pattern is identical," she said. "Same types of incidents, same timing intervals, same escalation on October anniversaries. Either Harold survived and continued, or the copycat is incredibly precise in replicating his methods."

"So we're back to Harold being alive," Angie said, disappointed.

"Or back to insufficient evidence," Donnie corrected.

They argued in circles for nearly an hour.

Donnie insisted on skepticism—innocent until proven guilty, even for ghosts. He pulled examples from the timeline, pointing out how certain incidents could have been executed by anyone with basic knowledge of the building. "Any former maintenance worker could have caused these failures. Any angry ex-employee could have set these fires."

Patricia countered with data suggesting continuity of actor. "The escalation pattern is too precise. Look at how the incidents increase in severity over time, always targeting the family's most vulnerable moments. That requires intimate knowledge of the Reeves family, sustained observation over decades."

Angie wanted to believe it wasn't Harold because that felt less terrifying than the truth. "If it's just some drifter copying Harold's plans, we can reason with him. Offer money, promise to leave him alone. But if it's Harold himself, driven by forty years of hatred..."

"Then we're dealing with pure revenge," Mark finished, his camera capturing their desperation for an answer that made sense. "No reasoning, no compromise, just endgame."

The debate circled back and forth, hope and evidence in constant tension.

Eleanor settled it.

"I have more proof," she said quietly. "In Harold's letters to me, he included details only he would know. Private family moments, conversations from childhood, things he said to our mother before she died. No stranger could know those details."

"Unless Harold told them before he died," Donnie said. "Shared his memories with whoever found him."

"He also sent photos. Polaroids of himself holding recent newspapers, standing in specific locations in the lodge that only family would recognize—our father's favorite chair in the office, the window where our mother used to watch snow fall. And in one photo, he's wearing the ring."

Everyone went still.

"You have that photo?" Owen asked.

"In my coat pocket. The one Harold took when he locked me in Room 9." Eleanor looked apologetic. "I didn't think to mention it before. My mind was..."

"Where's your coat?" Patricia was already moving.

"Lobby closet. We hung it there when you found me."

Patricia retrieved the coat, searched pockets. Pulled out a folded Polaroid, edges worn from handling.

She stared at it, face draining of color.

"What?" Owen crossed to her.

Patricia handed him the photo.

It showed a gaunt man sitting on a sleeping pallet in the attic nest—the same nest they'd found in Chapter 7. The man was skeletal, wild-haired, wearing layered filthy clothing. But his eyes were clear, bright with intelligence and madness mixed.

He held a newspaper: Denver Post, dated May 15, 1980. Six months ago, when Eleanor first received Harold's letters.

And on his left hand: silver wedding ring, visible even in the Polaroid's poor quality.

But what stopped Owen's breath was the man's face.

Older, weathered, damaged by years of hardship—but unmistakably the same face from Owen's childhood memory. The same face from family photos in the box.

Harold Reeves.

Alive.

Real.

Here.

Donnie took the photo, studied it, and his skepticism crumbled. "Christ. It's really him."

"I told you," Eleanor whispered.

The group passed the photo around. Each person confronted the evidence: Harold hadn't died in 1972. He'd been living in the building for eight years. Every incident, every act of sabotage, every stolen item—all Harold. One man, driven by delusion and revenge, slowly destroying his family's legacy while hiding in the walls like a rat.

The red herring was gone. The hope that this was someone else, something less personal, less intimate—evaporated.

They were trapped with Harold Reeves.

And he was coming for them.

Owen set down the photo, looked at his crew. "Donnie's right about one thing. We had insufficient evidence before. We were operating on assumptions. Now we know for certain: it's Harold, he's alive, and he's been here all along."

"So what do we do?" Angie asked.

"Same plan. We fortify, we wait for rescue, and we defend ourselves if he attacks." Owen's jaw set. "But now we know exactly who we're dealing with. Not a ghost. Not a stranger. My uncle Harold, architect of this building, who knows every secret it holds."

"And who's planning to burn it down with us inside," Mark added.

"Then we stop him," Owen said simply.

Patricia made a note in her timeline. Mark photographed the Polaroid for documentation. Donnie crushed his cigarette, mind already working on how to counter Harold's advantages.

Angie looked at the photo one more time, at the wild-eyed man staring into the camera, and shuddered.

"He looks insane."

"He is insane," Eleanor said. "Eight years alone with his delusions, talking to a building he thinks is alive. Harold's broken beyond repair."

"Broken people can still be stopped," Donnie said.

Owen hoped he was right.

The red herring was dead. The truth was confirmed.

Harold Reeves was alive, was here, was hunting them.

And rescue was still days away.

In the walls, Harold heard them accept the truth, heard them speak his name with certainty now instead of doubt.

Good.

Let them know.

It would make his justice all the sweeter.

The fire was coming.

And knowing wouldn't save them.
