# Chapter 11: The Passages

Afternoon. Donnie, Owen, and Mark prepared to enter Harold's domain.

They'd spend the morning gathering supplies: flashlights with fresh batteries, tools for prying panels, weapons for defense, rope for safety, Mark's portable cassette recorder for documentation. Patricia mapped their planned route using Harold's architectural drawings. Angie prepared emergency supplies in case they didn't return.

"Stay together," Patricia instructed. "Don't split up, no matter what you hear or see. Harold knows these passages better than anyone. Your only advantage is numbers."

"How long should we be gone?" Owen asked.

"Two hours, maximum. If you're not back by then, we come looking."

Eleanor spoke from her couch. "Be careful. Harold set traps in some passages—tripwires, loose floorboards. He told me about them in his letters, bragging about how clever he was."

Donnie checked his wrench. "We'll watch for them."

They entered through the storage closet panel on the second floor—the same access point they'd found days ago. Donnie went first, Owen second, Mark last with his recorder running.

The passage was narrow, cramped, dark. Flashlight beams cut through dust-thick air. Pipes and electrical conduits lined the walls. The smell was overwhelming—mildew, decay, human habitation.

"This way," Donnie said, consulting the architectural plans. "Main passage runs the length of the east wing, connects to vertical shaft at the end."

They moved single-file, crouched over, backs aching within minutes. The passage was barely two feet wide, forcing them to turn sideways in places.

Owen noticed details as they progressed: scratches on the walls where something heavy had been dragged, worn patches on the floor from repeated travel, cobwebs cleared from frequently-used routes.

Harold had lived here for eight years. Made these claustrophobic spaces his home.

They reached the first cache after fifteen minutes of crawling through the cramped passage.

An alcove off the main route, hidden behind a loose panel that would be invisible unless you knew exactly where to look. Donnie pulled it aside, revealing a small storage space packed with supplies.

The cache was meticulously organized. Canned food lined the back wall—labels from different decades telling a story of long-term scavenging. Campbell's soup from 1971. Del Monte vegetables from 1978. Recent brands stolen from their own supplies. Water jugs, some plastic (newer), some glass (old). Blankets folded neatly—worn guest linens from the lodge's operating years. A small kerosene heater, the kind designed for camping, well-maintained despite its age. Boxes of matches, each box half-used, showing Harold was careful with resources. Candles in various states of use, some burned down to nubs.

"Supply depot," Donnie said, his voice echoing slightly in the confined space. "He's got these scattered throughout the building. Classic survival strategy—never keep all your resources in one place. Can move between them, never stay in one location too long. Makes you harder to find, harder to trap."

Mark documented everything on audio, his cassette recorder capturing the details. "Cache one. Located in east wing passage, second floor level. Approximately fifteen feet from entry point. Contents: mixed-era canned goods, estimated three weeks' supply for one person. Water storage, bedding, heating source. Organization suggests long-term planning and sustained occupation."

Owen examined the cans more closely. His hands trembled slightly as he picked up a can of tomato soup dated 1973. Harold had stolen this from the kitchen twenty-seven years ago, stored it here, kept it as part of his survival network. Some cans showed rust, but most were in decent condition—the cool, dry passages had preserved them.

Other cans were newer. Owen recognized brands he'd seen in their own diminishing pantry. Harold had been stealing from them since the day they arrived, replenishing his caches with their supplies.

"He's been preparing for this moment for years," Owen said quietly. "Stockpiling food, fuel, everything he'd need to outlast us. We thought we had supplies for a week. He's got supplies for months."

"Look at this," Mark pointed his flashlight at the wall above the cache.

Writing. Scratched into the exposed wood with something sharp—a nail, maybe, or a piece of scrap metal. Same words repeated over and over, carved deep into the grain:

SHE SPEAKS TO ME
THE LODGE TELLS ME SECRETS
THEY WANT TO KILL HER
I PROTECT HER
MUST PROTECT HER
SHE TELLS ME WHO TO REMOVE
SHE TELLS ME WHO TO KEEP
SHE SPEAKS SHE SPEAKS SHE SPEAKS

The words covered every inch of available space, layered over each other in places where Harold had run out of room and started again.

"Jesus," Owen breathed, playing his flashlight across the obsessive scrawl. "He's been talking to the building for decades."

They continued deeper.

The passage connected to a vertical shaft—pipes running between floors, with enough space to climb using the pipes as handholds. Donnie tested them first, confirming they'd hold weight.

"Going down," he said.

They descended to the first floor, emerged in a different passage running behind the kitchen. From here, they could hear Angie and Patricia talking in the lobby, their voices muffled through walls.

Harold could hear everything. Every conversation, every plan, every secret. For eight years.

Donnie found another cache. More supplies, plus tools: screwdrivers, pliers, wire cutters. Equipment for sabotage.

And photographs.

Dozens of them, pinned to the wall with thumbtacks. Photos of guests from over the years—people Owen didn't recognize, smiling at cameras, unaware they were being watched. Each photo had notes scratched beside it in Harold's handwriting:

"Complained about heating - dealt with"
"Rude to staff - removed"
"Asked too many questions - silenced"

"This is sick," Mark whispered.

Owen found photos he did recognize: his father, younger, working at the front desk. His mother in the kitchen. Owen himself as a child, playing in the lobby.

All marked with Harold's obsessive notes.

"He's been watching the family for decades," Owen said. "Every visit, every moment. We were never alone here."

Donnie discovered something worse: a section of wall with peepholes drilled through at eye level. He looked through one—it provided a clear view into a guest room on the other side.

"Surveillance holes," Donnie said. "Cut into walls so he could watch guests without being seen. There's one here, another there..." He counted. "Six peepholes into different rooms."

Mark pressed his eye to one, pulled back immediately. "That's Room 12. Where I've been sleeping."

Harold had been watching them sleep.

They moved on, sickened but committed to mapping everything.

The passages grew more complex as they explored. Some routes were dead ends. Others connected to multiple floors. Some were wide enough to crouch-walk comfortably. Others forced them to crawl on hands and knees.

They found evidence of Harold's long occupation everywhere: food wrappers, empty water containers, makeshift furniture built from scavenged materials, clothing hanging from pipes to dry.

And the writing. On every surface Harold had access to, he'd scratched his delusions:

THE LODGE IS ALIVE
SHE SPEAKS AT NIGHT
MUST PROTECT HER FROM THIEVES
FIRE CLEANSES ALL SINS

They reached the basement level, emerged into a passage running beneath the lobby. Above them, they could hear footsteps—Patricia pacing, probably worried about how long they'd been gone.

Donnie found the main kerosene cache.

Twenty gallons, stored in five-gallon containers, hidden in an alcove behind the boiler room. Enough accelerant to burn the entire lodge to the ground.

"This is it," Donnie said grimly. "This is what he's planning to use."

Owen counted containers. "Can we move them? Get them out of the building?"

"Too heavy, too dangerous. If we spill it in these passages, the fumes alone could kill us." Donnie considered. "We could drain them into the snow outside through a basement window. Dilute and disperse the kerosene safely."

"Do it," Owen said.

While Donnie worked on safely disposing of the kerosene, Owen and Mark continued exploring.

They found Harold's true nest—different from the attic cache they'd discovered earlier. This one was deeper, more hidden, accessed through a crawlspace so narrow Owen barely fit.

A small chamber, maybe four feet by six feet, beneath the east wing's foundation. Sleeping pallet, personal belongings, and walls covered floor to ceiling with Harold's writings.

But these weren't random ravings. These were organized. Systematic.

Owen's flashlight revealed detailed plans:

ENDGAME - written large across one wall.

Beneath it: timeline of the family's arrival, daily schedules of each crew member, notes on their movements and habits, weaknesses identified.

"Owen - guilt-ridden, indecisive, can be manipulated"
"Angie - angry, impulsive, will act without thinking"
"Patricia - logical, needs proof, slow to accept danger"
"Donnie - skeptical, territorial, pride in expertise"
"Mark - curious, naive, trusts equipment over instinct"

Harold had been studying them like a predator studies prey.

And below the character analyses: THE PLAN

Fire locations marked. Accelerant distribution. Timing calculated. Escape routes blocked. Everything meticulously detailed.

Harold planned to set fires in six locations simultaneously: kitchen, basement boiler room, second floor east wing, second floor west wing, third floor storage, and the lobby barricade. With the crew trapped in the lobby, the fires would surround them, cutting off all escape.

The timeline read: "When the storm breaks. When they think rescue is near. When hope is highest. Then cleanse with fire."

Tomorrow. Or the next day. As soon as the weather cleared enough for them to believe they'd survived.

"We need to get this to the others," Owen said. "Now."

They retreated, moving quickly but carefully through passages, climbing back to the second floor. As they neared the exit panel, they heard something.

Movement. Behind them in the darkness. Something large, breathing hard, scrambling through the passages.

Harold.

He'd discovered them in his domain.

"Move!" Donnie shoved Mark toward the exit panel. "Go go go!"

They scrambled through the opening into the storage closet. Donnie was last, pulling himself through just as a hand—skeletal, filthy, strong—grabbed his ankle from the darkness.

Donnie kicked, connected with something soft. A grunt of pain. The hand released.

Donnie tumbled through, Owen slammed the panel shut.

From behind the wall: high-pitched laughter. Not human. Harold's voice, raspy and broken.

"Found you! Found you in my home! Trespassers! Thieves like all the rest!"

They backed away from the panel.

It rattled. Harold was on the other side, pounding, scratching.

"Tomorrow! Tomorrow the cleansing! She tells me it's time! Fire! FIRE FOR ALL OF YOU!"

Then silence.

The three men stood in the storage closet, breathing hard, hearts racing.

"We need to tell the others," Mark said, voice shaking. "Now."

They returned to the lobby, carrying the evidence of Harold's plan.

The endgame had begun.

And they were running out of time.
