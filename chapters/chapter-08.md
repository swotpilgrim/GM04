# Chapter 8: Patricia's Discovery

Patricia spent the afternoon in the office surrounded by files.

She'd sent the others away. She needed quiet to work, space to map the full scope of what Harold had done.

Sixty-three incidents. That's what her initial count showed. But she suspected that was just the documented ones—fires big enough to report, injuries severe enough for insurance claims, failures expensive enough for professional repairs.

How many smaller acts had gone unnoticed?

Patricia pulled every financial record. Maintenance logs. Purchase orders. Insurance correspondence. Repair invoices. Guest complaints.

She created categories.

**Fires:** Seven major incidents from 1960 to 1980. Kitchen fires, electrical fires, mysterious blazes. Insurance paid out, but premiums skyrocketed. After the fourth fire in 1974, the insurance company threatened to drop coverage.

**Equipment Failures:** Twenty-three incidents. Heating systems breaking in winter. Pipes bursting, flooding floors. Ski lifts failing. Refrigeration dying, spoiling food. Each cost thousands.

**Guest Injuries:** Twelve serious incidents. Collapsed railings. Broken stairs. Faulty wiring. Food poisoning. Each led to lawsuits, settlements, insurance claims.

**Vandalism and Theft:** Sixteen reported incidents. Broken windows. Stolen equipment. Damaged furniture. Graffiti. Dismissed as pranks or disgruntled employees. Nobody suspected systematic destruction from within.

Patricia mapped each incident to a timeline, then cross-referenced it with family events.

The pattern was undeniable.

June 1960: Harold's competency hearing. August 1960: First kitchen fire.

December 1962: Owen's parents' wedding announced. January 1963: Major pipe burst floods the entire second floor.

August 1968: Owen's birth. September 1968: Heating system fails, guests evacuate, negative press.

October 1972: Harold's disappearance. Every October since: significant incident without fail.

It wasn't random. It was calculated revenge, executed with precision over decades.

Patricia calculated financial impact.

Insurance premiums climbed from $3,000 annually in 1960 to $45,000 by 1978—fifteen times higher. Repairs totaled over $200,000. Lost revenue: easily over half a million dollars.

Owen's father took out loans to cover costs. Mortgaged the property three times. Worked sixteen-hour days trying to save a business Harold was methodically destroying.

And the stress killed him.

Patricia found medical records. James Reeves's first heart attack came in 1977—age sixty. Doctor's notes mentioned chronic stress, overwork. Second heart attack in 1979. Final fatal attack in October 1980, weeks before Owen arrived.

Harold hadn't just destroyed a business. He'd killed his own brother.

Murder. Slow, methodical, spanning decades, but murder nonetheless.

She heard footsteps in the hallway. Owen appeared in the doorway, looking exhausted.

"Found something?" he asked.

Patricia gestured to the spread of documents. "Everything. The complete picture of what Harold did to your family."

Owen entered, studied the timeline she'd created. His face went pale reading the financial summaries.

"My father's medical records," he said quietly, touching the file. "You found these?"

"Mixed with the business files. Owen, the stress from this sabotage killed him. The first heart attack came after the 1977 incidents—three major fires in six months. The second after the 1979 equipment failures that cost $30,000 to repair. And the final one..." Patricia hesitated. "October 1980. Right after another mysterious fire."

Owen's hands shook. "Harold killed him."

"Not directly. But yes."

Silence filled the office. Outside, wind battered the building. The heating system groaned.

"There's more," Patricia said gently. "The missing guests."

Owen looked up.

Patricia pulled three files, laid them on the desk. "Dennis Kohr, January 1974. Sarah Milliken, October 1975. Paul and Jean Torres, December 1977. All checked into the lodge during storms. All disappeared without a trace."

"People get lost in the mountains."

"Dennis Kohr's room was locked from the inside when search parties checked. His belongings were still there—wallet, ID, winter coat. Why would he leave without his coat in a blizzard?"

Owen picked up the file, read the police report.

"Sarah Milliken reported hearing sounds in the walls the night before she disappeared," Patricia continued. "She told the front desk someone was watching her. Staff dismissed it as paranoia. She was found... well, she wasn't found. Her room was empty, door locked, window sealed."

"And the Torres couple?"

"Checked in together. Last seen having dinner in the restaurant. Both vanished the same night. Their car was still in the parking lot, keys in the room. Police assumed they went hiking and got lost, but..." Patricia pointed to a detail in the report. "The search dogs tracked their scent to the basement, then lost it. Just stopped, like they'd vanished into thin air."

Owen set down the file. "You think Harold killed them."

"Eleanor said he'd been living in the walls since 1972. These disappearances happened in '74, '75, and '77. All during winter storms when the lodge was isolated." Patricia met his eyes. "What if they discovered him? Heard him in the walls, saw him emerging from passages, confronted him?"

"He'd have to silence them."

"Yes."

Owen walked to the window, stared out at the snow. "We need to tell the others."

"There's one more thing." Patricia pulled her final document—a purchase order from 1979. "Harold didn't just steal food and live off the lodge's supplies. He planned ahead. Look at this."

Owen took the paper. It was a supply order for the lodge, dated March 1979, signed by the assistant manager at the time.

Twenty gallons of kerosene. Unusual quantity for a lodge that used propane for heat.

"We only found one small kerosene heater in Harold's nest," Owen said.

"Right. So where are the other nineteen gallons?"

The implications settled like ice in Owen's chest. "He's been stockpiling accelerants."

"For years. This is just one order I found. There might be others." Patricia stood. "Harold's not just planning to burn the lodge down. He's been preparing for it for a long time. He has enough fuel to turn this building into an inferno."

---

They gathered in the lobby. Patricia presented her findings methodically—the sixty-three documented incidents, the financial destruction, the timeline aligned with family milestones, the medical evidence of James Reeves's stress-induced death.

Mark filmed it all, his face grim. Angie sat with her arms crossed, jaw tight. Donnie smoked, eyes on the floor. Eleanor wept quietly, guilt and grief overwhelming her.

"Sixty-three incidents," Angie repeated. "Over twenty years."

"That we know of," Patricia clarified. "There were likely more that weren't documented—small acts of vandalism, minor sabotage, things that seemed like bad luck or aging infrastructure."

"And three missing guests who probably discovered him," Mark added. "So we could add three murders to the count."

"Maybe more," Donnie said. "If he's been doing this since 1960, who knows how many people he's hurt."

Owen spoke quietly. "My father died because of this. The stress, the financial strain, the constant disasters. Harold didn't put a gun to his head, but he killed him just as surely."

Eleanor looked up, face wet with tears. "I should have stopped him. When he first wrote to me, I should have gone to the police. But I wanted to believe he could be helped, that he was still my brother. I was wrong."

"You're a victim too," Patricia said firmly. "Harold manipulated you, lured you here, locked you in that room. You nearly died because of him."

"But those three guests—if I'd acted six months ago, you all wouldn't be trapped here now."

"You didn't know," Owen said. "None of us knew. Harold spent forty years hiding, planning, destroying. He's a patient man."

"Not anymore," Donnie said. "He's escalating. The food theft, the equipment destruction, showing himself. He's moving toward endgame."

"The kerosene," Angie said. "Patricia found evidence he's been stock piling accelerants. That's not defensive. That's preparation for mass murder."

Mark lowered his camera. "We need a plan. We can't just wait for him to burn us alive."

"The storm should break tomorrow," Donnie said. "Maybe the day after. Roads cleared within two days of that. If we can survive four more days, rescue will come."

"Four days," Owen repeated. "Can we last that long?"

Patricia consulted her notes. "Food-wise, yes, if we're careful. The heating system is stable for now. Our biggest threat is Harold himself. If he lights fires before rescue arrives..."

"We die," Angie finished.

Silence settled over the group.

Owen thought about his father, working himself to death to save this lodge. About the three guests who'd disappeared into the walls, never to be found. About the years of careful sabotage, the decades of patient revenge.

Harold had been planning this moment for a long time.

And now they were here—trapped in a blizzard with a madman who knew every inch of the building, who'd been preparing to burn it down, who'd already killed at least four people.

"We fortify," Owen said. "Keep watch in shifts. Protect the lobby as our stronghold. And we find Harold's accelerant caches and destroy them. If we can eliminate his fuel, we reduce the threat."

"He could have kerosene hidden anywhere," Donnie pointed out. "In the walls, in the passages, stashed in dozens of locations. We'd never find it all."

"Then we find what we can." Owen looked at each of them. "We have four days. We use them to hunt Harold instead of hiding from him. We take back this building."

"Or die trying," Angie muttered.

"Or die trying," Owen agreed.

Patricia made notes. Mark checked his remaining audio cassettes. Donnie stubbed out his cigarette and stood, ready to begin searching.

Eleanor spoke up from the couch, voice weak but determined. "I know some of his hiding places. From his letters, he described parts of the lodge he called 'his spaces.' I can help you search."

"You need to rest," Owen said.

"I'll rest when Harold's stopped." Eleanor struggled to sit up. "He's my brother. I should have stopped him years ago. Let me help now."

Owen nodded. "Okay. Tomorrow, we search. We map every passage Donnie can access, find every cache of supplies and fuel, and we destroy it all. We take away Harold's advantages one by one."

"And if we encounter him?" Mark asked.

Owen picked up the fireplace poker. "We defend ourselves."

The group dispersed to their assigned tasks. Patricia to calculate food rations. Donnie to map accessible passages. Angie to prepare dinner with diminishing supplies. Mark to document everything on what remained of his cassettes.

Owen stood alone in the lobby, looking at the timeline Patricia had created—sixty-three red marks across forty years, each one representing Harold's hatred, his revenge, his patient destruction of a family.

Four more days.

They just had to survive four more days.

And then Harold's reign of terror would end, one way or another.

In the walls, Harold listened to their plans, their hopes, their desperate strategies.

And smiled.

Let them search. Let them hope. Let them think they had a chance.

The fire was coming.

And when it did, no amount of planning would save them.
