# Chapter 9: Harold's History

Owen stood in the lobby that evening, trying to remember his uncle.

He'd been four years old in 1972. Most memories from that age had faded to fragments—impressions, feelings, disconnected images. But one memory remained vivid, burned into his mind with the clarity that only childhood terror provides: the day Harold disappeared.

A man screaming in the office. Owen remembered the sound first—rage and desperation mixed, a voice raw from shouting. His father shouting back, trying to stay calm but failing. Owen had been playing with blocks in the lobby when it started. His mother had pulled him close, holding him behind her legs while the argument escalated.

The office door had burst open. A tall man emerged, wild-haired, wearing clothes that hadn't been washed in days. His eyes were bright with fury, pupils dilated, fixed on Owen's father with an intensity that made young Owen want to hide.

The man pointed at Owen. His hand shook. "That's the heir? The next thief in line?"

Owen's father stepped between them, hands raised in a placating gesture. "Harold, he's a child. Leave him out of this."

"A child who'll inherit what you stole! She told me he'd take her from me!" Harold's voice broke. "The lodge speaks, James! Don't you hear her? She tells me things! She's crying out against this injustice!"

Owen's mother had whispered something about calling the police. His father kept talking, kept trying to calm Harold, but it was useless. The man was beyond reason.

Then police arrived—Owen remembered their heavy boots on the wooden floor, their firm voices. They tried to talk Harold down first, then moved to restrain him when he lunged toward Owen's father.

Harold was escorted out, still screaming, voice echoing through the empty lobby. "She's mine! You stole her! I built her with my own hands! She's MINE!"

Owen had watched from the lobby window as police led Harold into the forest, toward the road where their car waited. But Harold had broken free for a moment, turned back toward the lodge, reached out to the building like reaching for a loved one.

"I'll come back to you!" Harold had screamed at the building itself. "I promise! I'll come back!"

Then he was gone, disappearing into the trees.

Never to be seen again.

Until now.

Patricia approached, notebook in hand. "I found more about Harold. Thought you should know the full story."

Owen turned from the window. "Tell me."

---

They sat by the fire. Patricia opened her notebook, reading from documents she'd compiled.

"Harold Reeves, born 1945. Brilliant from childhood—mathematics, engineering, architecture. Graduated MIT at twenty with degrees in structural engineering and architectural design. Worked for prestigious firms in Boston, made a name for himself designing innovative commercial buildings."

"How did he end up here?" Owen asked.

"Your father, James, was older by ten years. He'd inherited money from their parents, wanted to build a ski resort in Colorado. Approached Harold in 1950 with the proposal: James would finance it, Harold would design and oversee construction."

"Partnership."

"Equal partners on paper. Fifty-fifty ownership. Harold designed everything—the structural layout, the hidden maintenance passages for easy repairs, the heating systems, even the aesthetic details. Timberline was his masterpiece. Construction finished in 1951. Opening was a huge success."

Owen thought of his father's stories about those early years. The lodge full of guests, money flowing, the future bright.

"What went wrong?"

Patricia flipped pages. "Harold. His behavior changed around 1955. Became obsessive about the lodge. Spent hours alone in the building, refused to leave for days. Started talking to himself, claiming the building 'spoke' to him. Your father tried to help, but Harold grew paranoid—accused James of stealing profits, plotting against him, trying to push him out."

"Was my father stealing?"

"No. The financial records are meticulous. Equal distributions, fair accounting. But Harold couldn't be convinced. His paranoia intensified. In 1959, he attacked a guest who complained about room temperature, claimed the guest was 'disrespecting her.' The lodge. He called it 'her.'"

Owen rubbed his face. The pieces were falling into place.

"The family intervened in 1960," Patricia continued. "Competency hearing. I found the psychiatrist's evaluation in the files. Diagnosis: delusional disorder with obsessive attachment to inanimate object. The doctor wrote..." She found the page. "'Subject demonstrates clear break from reality regarding building structure. Refers to lodge as living entity, claims to hear it communicate, believes it requires his protection. Subject poses risk to self and others if delusions continue unchallenged.'"

"So they declared him incompetent."

"And bought out his share. The court approved a settlement: $10,000 for fifty percent ownership of a property valued at over $200,000. Harold fought it legally for years, lost every case. By 1970, he'd exhausted all appeals."

Donnie spoke up from across the lobby, where he'd been listening. "And in 1972, he snapped."

Patricia nodded. "October 1972. Harold showed up at the lodge unannounced, demanding to speak with James. Your father tried to reason with him, but Harold was beyond reason. Police were called. Harold was escorted off the property." She looked at Owen. "You remember that day?"

"Parts of it." Owen closed his eyes, pulling up the fragmented memory. "He was screaming about the lodge being stolen. About her—the building—telling him things. About me being the next thief."

"Harold left that day and never came back. Officially," Patricia said. "Search parties looked for him after he didn't return to his apartment in town. Found nothing. Declared legally dead in 1979."

"But he didn't die," Owen said. "He came back here. Hid in the building he'd designed."

"For eight years."

Eleanor's voice drifted from the couch, weak but clear. "He told me in his letters. The day police escorted him out, he walked into the forest. But he didn't walk away. He circled back after dark, entered through the basement—he'd left windows unlocked for maintenance access. Went into the passages he'd designed. And stayed."

Mark lowered his camera. "Living in the walls for eight years. That's impossible."

"Is it?" Donnie countered. "He knew every passage, every hiding spot. He could steal food from the kitchen, water from the taps, heat from the systems. And the lodge was barely occupied after 1975. Easy to avoid detection."

Patricia pulled another document. "I've been mapping Donnie's discoveries of the hidden passages against Harold's original architectural plans. The passages aren't standard maintenance access. They're extensive—connecting all three floors, with alcoves large enough for storage, routes wide enough to move quickly. Harold designed them specifically."

"For what?" Angie asked.

"Control," Owen said quietly. "He built hidden access into every part of the building so he could control it. Maintain it, monitor it, protect it from people he saw as threats."

"Or sabotage it," Patricia added. "The passages give access to electrical systems, plumbing, heating. Everything that broke over the years—Harold could reach it all from inside the walls."

Mark had been reviewing his footage. "I found him. In my B-roll from arrival day." He showed them the portable viewer. "Look at this."

The grainy film showed the lobby from Chapter 1. In the background, barely visible in a doorway's shadow, a thin figure stood watching.

"That's Harold," Mark said. "Been watching us since we arrived."

He showed more footage. Harold visible in three separate shots over two days. Always in shadow, always distant, always watching. Same gaunt figure, same wild hair, same skeletal frame.

"He's been studying us," Patricia said. "Learning our patterns, our movements, our vulnerabilities."

Eleanor struggled to sit up. "He's not the Harold I knew. My brother was brilliant, passionate, difficult—but human. What eight years alone did to him..." She trailed off. "In his letters, he wrote about the lodge telling him secrets. About voices in the walls. About cleansing fire and purification. He's not rational anymore. He's broken."

"Broken people are still dangerous," Donnie said.

Owen thought about his father, working himself to death against Harold's sabotage. About the three missing guests. About Eleanor locked in Room 9 for days. About the kerosene caches, the fire plan, the endgame.

"Why now?" he asked Eleanor. "You said he contacted you six months ago. Why escalate after years of hiding?"

"The sale," Eleanor said. "He learned the lodge was being sold to developers. That his creation would be torn down. In his mind, the building is alive, and you're planning to murder her. He sees himself as her protector, her guardian. He'll kill to save her."

"And if he can't save her?" Angie asked.

"Then he'll burn her himself. On his terms. With witnesses to his justice—the family that stole her from him."

Silence settled over the group.

Owen stood, walked to the windows. Outside, snow continued falling. The storm would break tomorrow, maybe the next day. Roads cleared within days after that.

But Harold's timeline was shorter.

"We need to understand him," Owen said. "Donnie, you keep mapping passages. Find his caches, his supplies, his fuel stores. Mark, review all footage. Document everywhere he appears, map his movements. Patricia, keep analyzing—find patterns in when he sabotaged, predict when he'll strike next."

"And you?" Angie asked.

"I'm going to talk to Eleanor. Learn everything she knows about Harold—his methods, his thinking, his weaknesses. He's family. Maybe I can reach him."

"You think you can reason with him?" Donnie sounded skeptical.

"No." Owen met his eyes. "But I can try to predict him. He's spent eight years planning revenge on this family. I'm part of that family. Understanding what he wants from me might help us survive."

The group dispersed. Donnie to the passages. Patricia to her notes. Mark to his equipment.

Owen sat with Eleanor, asking about the brother she remembered—before the madness, before the walls, when Harold Reeves was still human.

And in the darkness above, Harold listened to them speak his name, heard them try to understand him, and laughed softly.

They could study him all they wanted.

It wouldn't save them.

The fire was coming soon.

Very soon.
