# Chapter 3: Trapped

Owen woke to silence.

Wrong kind of silence. He'd grown up in these mountains, knew the difference between quiet and dead air. This was the latter—sound swallowed by something massive.

He checked his watch: 6:23 AM. Gray light leaked around the window curtain. Owen sat up, breath visible in the cold.

He pulled the curtain aside.

Snow pressed against the window, packed tight from ground to frame top. Three feet at least. He couldn't see the parking lot, couldn't see the pines. Just white, solid and absolute.

The storm had hit.

Owen dressed quickly and stepped into the hallway. The building was quiet except for the wind howling outside, testing the windows.

He found Donnie in the lobby, standing at the windows with coffee. The view should have shown the circular drive. Instead: white wall. Drifts had buried the first floor windows completely.

"Christ," Owen muttered.

"Ten-year storm, minimum." Donnie's voice was flat. "Three feet already. Wind gusting fifty. Visibility zero."

"Vehicles?"

"Buried. Road's gone. Won't see pavement for a week."

Owen's stomach tightened. "Phone?"

"Dead. Ice on the lines."

"CB radio?"

"Works. Contacted the ranger station." Donnie met Owen's eyes. "Road won't be cleared for five days minimum. More likely seven. We're low priority—private road, no permanent residents."

Five days minimum. Seven likely.

They'd planned for three.

"We have supplies. We have heat. We can make this work."

"If the heating system holds."

"It'll hold."

"And if it doesn't, we freeze in our sleep." Donnie lit a cigarette. "Just so we're clear."

---

By seven AM, everyone had gathered in the lobby.

Patricia stood near the fireplace, clipboard in hand. Mark filmed the snow-blocked windows. Angie sat on a couch, arms crossed, jaw tight.

Owen explained the situation: massive storm, completely trapped, rescue minimum five days away.

Angie stood before he finished.

"This is your fault."

"Angie—"

"I said we should leave yesterday. You insisted we stay." Her voice climbed. "You put this lodge ahead of our lives. Again."

"The forecast said tomorrow afternoon. No one predicted this."

"Donnie did. But you didn't listen, because you never listen, because you're just like your father—"

"Don't." Owen's voice went hard. "Don't bring him into this."

"Why not? He sacrificed everything for this building. You're doing the same. Now we're trapped. Hope it was worth it."

Silence. Mark lowered his camera.

Donnie spoke up, voice gruff. "Storm would've caught us on the road. We'd be dead in a ditch. At least here we've got walls and heat."

"For now," Angie shot back. "Until something fails."

"Enough." Owen stepped forward. "We're here. Fighting doesn't help. We need to survive the next week."

"We brought food for three days."

"Then we ration." Owen turned to Patricia. "What do we actually have?"

Patricia consulted her notes. "Canned goods, dried goods, perishables. Emergency supplies in the basement—more canned food. Haven't counted it yet."

"How long can we stretch it?"

"Five days minimum. We'll be hungry, but we won't starve. Seven days will be tight."

"Heating fuel?" Owen asked Donnie.

"Propane tank three-quarters full. Firewood enough for two weeks. Heating system should run unless something breaks." Donnie stubbed out his cigarette. "Which is a real possibility."

"Then we monitor it. Shifts, round the clock."

Mark raised his hand. "What about communication?"

"CB radio works," Owen said. "Ranger station can't do anything until the storm passes and roads clear. We're on the list. We just have to wait."

"Trapped in a creepy lodge with limited food." Mark gave a weak smile. "Best documentary footage ever or my last will and testament."

Nobody laughed.

---

Owen assigned tasks.

Donnie would monitor the heating system, checking pressure every two hours. Patricia would inventory all food and supplies, create rationing schedule. Mark would document everything with his camera.

Angie would manage the kitchen and food preparation. She argued—"I'm not your chef anymore, Owen"—but he pointed out she was the only one who knew how to cook with limited ingredients.

She took the assignment with a glare that could melt snow.

Owen took on building security: checking windows and doors, looking for damage, keeping the structure sound.

By nine AM, everyone scattered to their tasks.

Owen checked the first floor. Most windows were fine. In the storage closet he found a broken latch—cold air whistling through. He stuffed a towel in the gap.

On the second floor, the east wing was solid. The west wing had water damage where snow had forced under a window frame. He mopped it up, sealed the frame with duct tape.

On the third floor, Owen paused. The building felt different up here. Emptier. The weight of sixty empty rooms, decades of silence pressing down.

He checked Room 34, where Donnie's wrench had gone missing. Everything looked normal. Empty guest room, bare mattress.

He locked it and moved on.

At noon, they gathered in the kitchen for lunch.

Patricia had calculated rations: one full meal per day, shared dinner. Snacks only if necessary. Water was unlimited, but they should boil it to be safe—this building's pipes were old.

Angie had made rice with canned vegetables, stretched it to fill five bowls. It wasn't much, but it was hot.

They ate in silence, the wind howling outside.

"I need to do full inventory of the basement," Patricia said between bites. "Owen, can you help? Some of those boxes are heavy."

"Sure."

"I'll come too," Mark offered. "Get footage of the supplies."

After lunch, the three of them descended to the basement.

The basement was colder than the main floors, concrete walls sweating moisture. Donnie's sleeping bag was rolled up near the boiler, which rumbled and hissed in the corner. Storage shelves lined the walls, packed with boxes and forgotten equipment.

Patricia moved methodically, opening boxes, counting contents, making notes. Most were maintenance supplies—lightbulbs, cleaning products, toilet paper. But in the back corner, Owen found the emergency food cache.

Three large boxes labeled "Emergency Supplies - 1978." Inside: canned soup, canned vegetables, canned fruit, dried beans, rice, powdered milk. Enough to feed the lodge staff for weeks if they'd ever needed it.

"This helps," Patricia said, updating her count. "With this, we can last ten days easily, maybe two weeks if we're careful."

"Rescue will come before that." Owen lifted another box onto the table. "Five days, seven at most."

"Assuming nothing else goes wrong," Patricia said quietly.

Mark filmed the supplies, the boxes, the concrete walls. He panned to the boiler, to Donnie's makeshift sleeping area, to the shadows gathering in the corners.

Owen noticed something on the floor near the shelves: footprints in the dust. Recent, larger than his own. Work boots, worn tread.

Like the ones in Room 17 yesterday.

"Someone's been down here," Owen said.

Patricia looked up. "When?"

"I don't know. Recently." Owen crouched, studying the prints. They led from the stairs to the shelves, then disappeared into an area blocked by equipment. "Donnie, probably. Checking supplies."

But Donnie had spent most of his time in this basement, and the floor around his sleeping area was clear of dust from his constant movement. These prints were isolated, deliberate—someone who'd come down, gone straight to the shelves, and left.

Mark filmed the footprints. "Should we ask him?"

"Maybe." Owen stood, uneasy. "Or maybe I'm seeing things that aren't there."

They finished the inventory and climbed back upstairs.

---

Afternoon bled into evening. The storm didn't let up. If anything, it intensified—wind screaming, snow piling higher against the building. The lodge creaked and groaned under the assault.

Donnie checked the heating system every two hours like clockwork. Patricia updated her calculations. Mark filmed constantly, burning through his film stock. Angie prepared dinner in hostile silence—canned soup, heated on the camping stove, served with crackers that were already going stale.

Owen made another circuit of the building, checking for problems. Everything was holding. For now.

At seven PM, Patricia went to the office to file her inventory notes. She needed the key to the filing cabinet.

The office key board was mounted on the wall—brass hooks holding brass keys, each labeled. Most were room keys: Room 1, Room 2, Room 3... all the way to Room 60. Staff keys. Storage keys.

Patricia scanned the board, looking for the filing cabinet key.

Her eyes caught on an empty hook.

Room 9.

The key to Room 9 was missing.

Patricia frowned, checked again. Definitely gone. She remembered it being there two days ago—she'd inventoried all the keys when they arrived, made notes about which rooms still had functional locks.

"Owen!" she called.

He appeared in the doorway, looking tired. "What's wrong?"

"Room 9's key is missing." She pointed at the empty hook. "It was here when we arrived. Now it's gone."

Owen studied the board. "Who would take it?"

"I don't know. Maybe someone needed to check that room?" But Patricia's notes showed she'd already inventoried Room 9—empty, like all the others.

"Could've fallen off," Owen suggested.

They searched the floor, under the desk, in the drawers. No key.

"This is the second thing that's gone missing," Patricia said. "First Donnie's wrench, now this."

"The wrench turned up."

"In a room we hadn't entered. Someone moved it."

Owen wanted to argue, but couldn't. The evidence was there: missing items, mysterious footprints, a key that had vanished.

"Maybe one of us is just forgetting where we put things," he said. "Stress does that."

Patricia adjusted her glasses. "Maybe."

But neither of them believed it.

---

That night, they stayed together in the lobby.

A fire burned in the stone fireplace, casting shadows across the walls. The wind screamed outside, rattling windows, testing the building's strength. Snow had buried the first floor completely—when Owen looked out the lobby windows, all he saw was white packed against glass.

They were entombed.

Donnie sat closest to the fire, smoking. Patricia reviewed her notes by flashlight. Mark fiddled with his camera equipment. Angie stared into the flames, jaw tight. Owen stood near the windows, watching the storm.

"Seven days," Angie said to no one in particular. "We just have to survive seven days."

"Five, probably," Owen replied.

"Right. Five." She didn't sound convinced.

The building groaned around them, timbers settling under the weight of snow. Somewhere in the walls, pipes clanged. The heating system hissed and rattled.

Outside, the storm raged.

Inside, in the darkness between floors, behind walls and beneath ceilings, Harold Reeves listened to the voices below.

Five people. Trapped. Just as he'd planned.

He smiled in the darkness and waited for morning.

The hunt was about to begin.
