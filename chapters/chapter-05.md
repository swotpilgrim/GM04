# Chapter 5: The Keeper

Evening settled over the lodge like a weight.

The woman—Eleanor, though they didn't know her name yet—slept fitfully on the couch near the fire. Color had returned to her face, but the frostbite on her fingers and toes looked bad. Donnie said she'd likely lose at least one toe, maybe more. No way to get her to a hospital until the roads cleared.

They'd have to hope her body could fight the damage on its own.

The group gathered in the lobby, speaking in low voices while Eleanor slept.

"She has to be a squatter," Angie said, arms crossed. "Someone who broke in during the off-season, was hiding when we arrived."

Patricia shook her head. "Then why lock herself in Room 9? And how did she get so severely hypothermic? That takes days of exposure."

"Maybe she got locked in by accident. Panicked, couldn't get out."

"With no food or water? She'd be dead."

"Well, she's not dead, is she?" Angie's voice rose slightly. "So explain that."

"I can't." Patricia adjusted her glasses. "None of this makes sense."

Donnie spoke up from his position by the fire. "Maybe she's been here longer than we think. Hiding in different rooms, moving around, avoiding us. Finally got trapped in Room 9 when the storm hit."

"For two days?" Owen shook his head. "Without heat? Without touching our food supplies? And no one saw or heard her?"

"People can be quiet when they want to be."

Mark had been silent, sitting cross-legged on the floor with old lodge brochures spread around him. He looked up. "Or maybe she's not entirely... corporeal."

Everyone stared at him.

"Corporeal?" Angie repeated.

"I've been reading through this old promotional material from the 1950s." Mark held up a yellowed brochure. "There's a local legend mentioned here. 'The Keeper.' A mountain spirit that supposedly protects empty places."

"Oh, for Christ's sake," Donnie muttered.

"No, listen." Mark flipped through pages. "The legend says the Keeper appears during storms, traps trespassers who violate sacred spaces. Sometimes the trespassers are found frozen, sometimes they just disappear."

"That's folklore," Patricia said. "Tourist attraction nonsense to make the lodge seem mysterious."

"Maybe." Mark pulled out another document—a photocopied newspaper clipping. "But look at this. Winter 1952, during a blizzard. Guest named Thomas Whitmore disappeared from his room. Search parties found nothing. He was never seen again."

Owen felt something cold settle in his stomach. "1952."

"Right. And Eleanor kept saying that year. '1952... he's still here... 1952...'" Mark looked at each of them. "What if she's connected to that somehow?"

"She'd be in her twenties in 1952," Patricia calculated. "She's about seventy now. The timeline works."

"Or," Donnie said flatly, "she's an old woman suffering from hypothermia and delirium who latched onto a year she saw somewhere in this building. Not everything is supernatural."

"I know it sounds crazy—"

"It doesn't sound crazy. It *is* crazy."

Angie spoke up. "What about the locked door? And no footprints outside the window? Donnie, you checked the room. How do you explain that?"

Donnie had no answer.

Owen stood, walked to the windows. Outside, the storm continued. Snow pressed against glass. The wind howled like something alive.

"Whether she's a squatter, a ghost, or something else," he said, "she's real. She's here. And she mentioned Harold."

"Your uncle who disappeared," Mark said.

"In 1972." Owen turned to face them. "Twenty years after the 1952 incident. Could be coincidence."

"Or connection," Mark suggested.

Patricia pulled out her notes. "I've been mapping the incidents I found in the insurance files. There was a cluster of problems in the early 1950s—right around when that guest disappeared. Then things got worse in 1960. And they've continued ever since."

"Continued how?" Owen asked.

"Fires. Equipment failures. Injuries. Like the building itself is fighting against being used." Patricia met his eyes. "Or like someone is sabotaging it."

The word hung in the air.

Sabotage.

Owen thought about his father's endless struggles, the mounting debts, the accidents that seemed to multiply year after year. His father had died thinking he was cursed or incompetent.

But what if someone had been destroying the lodge deliberately?

Eleanor stirred on the couch. Her eyes opened, unfocused and glassy.

"Miss?" Angie moved closer. "Can you hear me?"

Eleanor's gaze found Angie, then moved across the faces surrounding her. Fear flickered in her eyes.

"Who are you?" Eleanor's voice was hoarse, barely above a whisper.

"I'm Angie. This is Owen, Patricia, Donnie, and Mark. We found you in one of the guest rooms. You were freezing. We brought you to the fire."

"The fire..." Eleanor tried to sit up, winced. "My hands..."

"You have frostbite," Patricia said gently. "We can't get you to a doctor until the storm passes. But you're warming up. You'll be okay."

Eleanor looked at her blackened fingers. Tears welled in her eyes. "How long was I in there?"

"We don't know," Owen said. "When did you arrive at the lodge?"

"I..." Eleanor's brow furrowed. "I don't... it's hard to remember..."

"That's okay. Take your time."

Eleanor closed her eyes, breathing slowly. "He contacted me. Sent a letter. Said he had proof. Said I needed to come see for myself."

"Who contacted you?" Owen knelt beside the couch.

"My brother." Eleanor opened her eyes, looked directly at Owen. "Harold. Harold Reeves."

The room went still.

Owen felt his pulse hammering. "Harold Reeves is your brother?"

"Yes. I thought he was dead. Everyone said he died in 1972. But he wrote to me. Six months ago. Said he'd been here all along. Said he needed me to witness what they did to him."

"Who's 'they'?" Patricia asked.

"The family. His brother. The people who stole his legacy." Eleanor's voice strengthened slightly. "He built this place. Designed every detail. But they took it from him. Declared him incompetent, bought him out for nothing."

Owen's throat tightened. "His brother was my father."

Eleanor studied him. "You're James's son?"

"Owen. Owen Reeves."

"Then you're Harold's nephew." Eleanor's expression shifted—something like pity. "He spoke about you in his letters. Said you were just a child when he left. Said you wouldn't remember him."

"I barely do." Owen's mind reeled. "But Harold's dead. He disappeared eight years ago in a blizzard. His body was never found, but—"

"His body was never found because he never died." Eleanor's hand shot out, grabbed Owen's wrist with surprising strength despite the frostbite. Her eyes were wide, urgent. "He's here. In this building. He's been here for eight years, living in the walls, watching everyone. He lured me here. Locked me in that room. Said I betrayed him just like the rest of the family."

"That's impossible," Donnie said. "No one could survive eight years in the walls of this building."

"He knows every passage, every hidden space. He built them himself." Eleanor's grip tightened on Owen's wrist. "He's not right anymore. Something broke in him. He talks to himself, talks to the building like it's alive. He said it speaks to him, tells him things."

Angie stepped back. "This is insane."

"I know how it sounds." Eleanor released Owen's wrist, slumped back. "But I saw him. Gaunt, wild, like an animal. He's been sabotaging this place for decades. Every accident, every fire. It was Harold. All of it."

The wind screamed outside.

Somewhere above them, in the silent hallways of the second floor, something creaked.

Everyone looked up.

"Old building," Donnie said. But his voice lacked conviction.

Another creak. Then another. Rhythmic. Deliberate.

Footsteps.

Someone was walking in the hallway directly above the lobby.

"Did you hear that?" Mark whispered.

Donnie stood, grabbed his wrench. Owen picked up the fireplace poker. They moved toward the stairs, weapons ready.

"Wait," Angie hissed. "You're going up there?"

"We need to know," Owen said.

He and Donnie climbed the stairs quietly, flashlights cutting through the darkness. The second floor hallway stretched before them, doors closed, shadows thick.

The footsteps had stopped.

They advanced slowly, checking each door. All locked, just as they'd left them.

Donnie pointed. At the far end of the hallway, near the east wing, there were wet footprints on the carpet.

Fresh footprints. Leading from the stairwell to the wall.

Owen's skin crawled. They approached the prints carefully. Adult-sized, work boots with worn tread. The same prints they'd seen in Room 17 and the basement.

The prints led to the wall and stopped.

Not at a door. At the wall itself.

Donnie ran his hand along the paneling. His fingers found a seam. He pressed, and a section of wall shifted.

A hidden panel.

Behind it: darkness. A narrow space, maybe two feet wide. The smell that wafted out was awful—mildew, old sweat, decay.

Donnie shined his flashlight into the opening. The beam revealed a crawlspace extending into the walls, pipes and wiring visible, dust thick on everything.

And footprints in the dust. Recent ones. Leading deeper into the darkness.

"Jesus Christ," Donnie breathed.

A sound echoed from somewhere in the passages—scraping, then silence.

Something was in there. Something that had just heard them open the panel.

Owen grabbed the panel edge, slammed it shut. The section clicked back into place, flush with the wall.

They stood in the hallway, breathing hard.

"What the hell was that?" Donnie's hands were shaking.

"A passage," Owen said. "Hidden maintenance access. Harold would know about it. He designed the building."

"You think he's really in there? Living in the walls?"

Owen thought about Eleanor's words. About the footprints. About eight years of sabotage that killed his father.

"Yeah," he said quietly. "I think he is."

They returned to the lobby. Everyone looked at them expectantly.

"Well?" Angie demanded.

"There's someone in the walls," Owen said. "We found a hidden panel. Passages behind it. Fresh footprints."

"Did you see anyone?"

"No. But they're there."

Mark's face had gone pale. "The Keeper legend..."

"Isn't a legend," Donnie interrupted. "It's a man. A real, flesh-and-blood man living in the building like a rat."

Eleanor nodded from the couch. "Harold. I told you. He's been here all along."

The fire crackled. Outside, the storm raged.

And in the walls—in the narrow spaces between floors, in the hidden passages only the builder knew—Harold Reeves listened to the voices below.

They knew he was here now.

The game had changed.

And Harold smiled in the darkness, preparing for the hunt to begin.
