# Chapter 1: Arrival

The mountain road turned to dirt twelve miles back.

Owen gripped the Bronco's steering wheel as the tires climbed higher into the Colorado Rockies. November cold seeped through the door seals. In the passenger seat, Patricia studied a clipboard, her breath visible in small clouds. Behind them, Angie stared out the window, arms crossed, and Mark filmed the pine forest with his Bolex camera.

"How much farther?" Patricia asked.

"Five miles. Maybe six." Two years since his father's death, and this was it—the final trip to Timberline Lodge. After this week, it would belong to someone else.

In the rearview mirror, Donnie's pickup followed, exhaust puffing white in the cold afternoon air. The convoy climbed through switchbacks, elevation markers ticking higher. 9,200 feet. 9,400. The air thinned. Owen cranked his window down an inch—fresh pine smell, clean and sharp.

"You could at least pretend this is hard for you," Angie said from the back seat.

Owen caught her eyes in the mirror. Green and sharp. "I'm not pretending anything."

"Right. Just business." She turned back to the window.

Mark lowered his camera. "How long did your family own it?"

"My father and uncle built it in 1951," Owen said. "Uncle Harold designed it. My father ran it."

"And now you're selling it to developers." Angie's voice carried an edge that made Patricia glance up from her clipboard.

"And now I'm selling it," Owen confirmed. "Because it's bankrupt. Because keeping it would mean losing everything else."

Silence settled, broken only by the engine's grind and tires on gravel. Mark raised his camera again, filming the dashboard, Owen's hands on the wheel.

"Could you not?" Owen said.

"Documentary requires authentic moments," Mark replied.

"The death of American dreams is going to happen with that camera up your ass if you don't—"

"There," Patricia interrupted, pointing ahead.

The road curved around a stand of pines, and Timberline Lodge appeared.

Three stories of timber and stone sat in a clearing, windows dark and empty, surrounded by early snow that had accumulated in drifts against the north wall. The architecture was mid-century modern—clean lines, large windows, a flat roof that had seen better decades. Someone had tried to maintain it, but time had won. Paint peeled near the eaves. One section of gutter hung loose. The massive windows that should have gleamed reflected nothing but gray sky.

Owen pulled into the circular drive and killed the engine. Behind them, Donnie's pickup rattled to a stop.

"Christ," Angie muttered. "It looks worse than last time."

She wasn't wrong. Owen climbed out, his boots crunching on gravel mixed with snow. The building loomed above them, sixty empty rooms waiting like a mouth full of dark teeth. His father had died trying to save this place. Worked himself to exhaustion, chasing one disaster after another—fires, equipment failures, accidents that insurance barely covered. Dead at sixty-two from stress and a heart that gave out.

And for what? So Owen could sell it for parts.

"You okay?" Patricia stood beside him, her coat pulled tight against the cold. She was small, maybe five-foot-three, but her voice carried surprising steadiness.

"Fine." Owen pulled keys from his pocket—a heavy ring of brass keys, some labeled, some not. "Let's get the gear unloaded."

Mark was already filming the lodge exterior, walking backward to capture the full frame. Donnie climbed out of his pickup, a barrel-chested man in a flannel shirt and work boots, squinting up at the building.

"Storm's coming," Donnie announced, lighting a hand-rolled cigarette. "Radio said tomorrow, but I can smell it. Tonight, maybe."

"We've got three days to winterize," Owen said. "Plenty of time."

Donnie exhaled smoke. "If you say so."

They unloaded supplies from both vehicles—boxes of tools, food for three days, sleeping bags, Mark's film equipment in battered cases. Angie carried two bags of groceries toward the main entrance, moving with the efficient irritation of someone who'd made this trip too many times before.

Owen unlocked the front door. The lock stuck, then gave with a heavy click.

Inside, the lobby stretched toward darkness. The smell hit him first—dust, mildew, old wood, and something else underneath. Abandonment had a smell. Owen found the light switches, flipped them. Overhead fluorescents flickered to life, humming and casting harsh light across the space.

The lobby had been beautiful once. His father used to tell stories about opening night in 1951—women in dresses, men in suits, a band playing near the stone fireplace that dominated the far wall. Now the carpet showed trails of wear down to backing, the furniture sat under dusty sheets, and water stains darkened the ceiling tiles.

"Home sweet home," Angie said, setting down the groceries near the reception desk.

Mark filmed everything, panning slowly across the empty space. "This is perfect. The decay, the atmosphere. Owen, can you stand by the fireplace? I want to get you in frame with—"

"No," Owen said.

"It's for the documentary. 'Dying Americana: The Last—'"

"I said no."

Mark lowered the camera, looking hurt. He was twenty-six, shaggy blond hair and wire-frame glasses held together with tape. Earnest. Owen almost felt bad.

Patricia pulled out her clipboard. "I need to inventory the kitchen equipment first. Angie, can you help me catalog what's functional?"

"Sure." Angie shrugged out of her coat. Underneath she wore a thermal shirt and jeans, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical ponytail. She looked tired. They all did.

Donnie headed for the basement stairs. "I'll check the heating system. Don't want to freeze our asses off tonight."

"I'll show Mark the layout," Owen offered. "Get him oriented."

Angie shot him a look he couldn't quite read, then followed Patricia toward the kitchen.

---

Owen led Mark through the first floor, unlocking doors and flipping light switches. The building felt wrong—too empty, too quiet. Their footsteps echoed on worn linoleum and carpet.

"Sixty guest rooms total," Owen explained, "spread across the second and third floors. Commercial kitchen, staff quarters down that hallway, basement has all the mechanical systems. Donnie knows them better than anyone."

Mark filmed the hallways, the closed doors, the water-stained ceiling. "How long has Donnie worked here?"

"Eighteen years. Longer than anyone else." Owen tried a light switch—nothing happened. Burned-out bulb. "He's staying on until the sale closes. Needs the money."

"And Angie?"

Owen stopped walking. "What about her?"

"Patricia mentioned she's your ex-wife. That must be complicated."

"It's fine."

"But—"

"It's fine," Owen repeated. "She needed the work. I needed a chef for the final inventory. It's business."

Mark had the decency not to push it. They continued the tour, climbing stairs to the second floor. More hallways, more empty rooms. Owen unlocked one at random—Room 23. Inside: two twin beds with bare mattresses, a dresser with all the drawers removed, curtains that had faded to the color of old newspapers.

"Depressing," Mark observed.

"It was nice once." Owen heard the defensive note in his voice and hated it. "People came here for skiing, for vacation. My parents' wedding reception was in the main dining room."

"When did it start going wrong?"

Owen pulled the door closed, locked it. "1960, maybe. Earlier. I don't know. Before I was born, there were incidents—fires, accidents. Insurance costs went up. Guests stopped coming. My father spent his whole life fighting to keep it open."

"And you're the one who has to let it go."

"Yeah." Owen started back toward the stairs. "Lucky me."

They returned to the lobby as the afternoon light began to fade. Patricia and Angie emerged from the kitchen, both looking frustrated.

"Half the equipment is rusted through," Patricia reported. "The industrial freezer works, but the stove is shot. I'm revising the auction estimates."

Angie added, "Also, someone left food in the pantry. Canned goods, jerky. Locked pantry."

Owen frowned. "From when?"

"I don't know. Recent, maybe? Didn't smell spoiled."

"Probably forgot to clear it last season." But that didn't make sense. Owen had done a final check himself in October. The pantry had been empty.

Donnie emerged from the basement, oil-stained and scowling. "Heating system's running, but barely. Got maybe three days before something fails. This whole place is held together with rust and prayers."

"Three days is all we need," Owen said.

"Storm's coming tonight," Donnie repeated, stubbing out his cigarette in an empty coffee can. "I'm telling you, I can feel it in my knees. We should think about heading down the mountain."

"We just got here," Patricia said.

"And we'll leave when the work's done." Owen tried to sound more confident than he felt. "Let's get settled. Assign rooms, get some food, figure out tomorrow's schedule."

They divided up the staff quarters off the main hallway—small rooms with single beds, meant for seasonal workers. Owen took the one his father used to use. Angie took the room farthest from his. Patricia chose one near the office. Mark set up in a corner room with good light for his equipment. Donnie said he'd sleep in the basement near the heating systems, "in case something breaks."

Dinner was canned soup heated on a camping stove in the kitchen—Angie refused to trust the building's appliances. They ate in silence around the prep counter, exhaustion settling in.

"I need interviews," Mark said between spoonfuls. "For the documentary. Owen, can we do yours tonight?"

"Tomorrow."

"But the light is—"

"Tomorrow," Owen repeated. "I'm tired."

Mark looked like he wanted to argue, then nodded.

After dinner, Mark set up his camera equipment in the lobby on a tripod, filming time-lapse footage of the fireplace. Donnie headed to the basement. Patricia retreated to her room with a box of financial files. Angie washed dishes with unnecessary force, the metal clanging echoing through the empty kitchen.

Owen found himself alone in the lobby, standing near the cold fireplace. He should start a fire. He should check the locks. He should do something productive.

Instead, he stood there, looking up at the vaulted ceiling, at the chandelier that hadn't worked in a decade, at the family legacy crumbling around him.

His father had loved this place. Loved it enough to die for it. And Owen was selling it to developers who'd probably tear it down and build condos.

"I'm sorry, Dad," he whispered to the empty room.

The building creaked in response, settling into the cold night.

Owen shook himself, headed toward the staff quarters. Tomorrow would be brutal—full day of winterization work, inventory, boarding up windows. He needed sleep.

He didn't see the small hole drilled through the wall near the ceiling, positioned at eye level for someone crouching in the space behind the paneling. Didn't notice the faint movement as something shifted in the darkness beyond.

In the walls above the lobby, eyes watched Owen retreat down the hallway.

And in that hidden darkness, Harold Reeves smiled.
