# Chapter 14: First Sabotage

Mid-afternoon. The lobby lights flickered once, twice, then died completely.

Owen looked up from the journal he'd been reading. Outside the windows, gray daylight still filtered through snow, but inside the lodge, darkness swallowed everything except the dying firelight.

"Power's out," Donnie said unnecessarily from across the room.

Patricia glanced at the overhead fixtures. "Storm damage?"

"Weather's been stable for hours." Donnie stood, already moving toward the basement stairs. "This is something else."

Owen grabbed a flashlight, followed him to the basement. The corridor was cold. Without power, the lodge would start losing heat within hours.

The electrical room door stood open. Donnie had closed it that morning.

Owen swept his flashlight across the room. The main electrical panel hung open, master breaker thrown to off. Wiring hung loose, clean knife cuts visible on several cables.

"He did this while we were upstairs," Donnie said.

Owen's skin crawled. Harold had been here minutes ago, maybe was still close—

A sound stopped his thought. Scraping. Metal against concrete. Coming from the walls to their left, then shifting, moving around the room's perimeter. Rapid, purposeful. Like something circling.

Donnie froze, wrench raised. "You hear that?"

"Yeah." Owen's flashlight tracked the sound but revealed nothing. The scraping continued—behind them now, then to the right. Harold was in the passages, maybe ten feet away.

Watching them.

Donnie moved to the panel, hands shaking. The knife cuts were precise—just enough to disable without causing sparks. Harold knew exactly what he was doing.

The scraping grew louder. Owen turned slowly, flashlight sweeping shadows. The basement stretched in all directions, creating a maze of hiding places.

"Donnie—"

"Almost got it." Sweat beaded on Donnie's forehead despite the cold. He reconnected cables, hands working with practiced efficiency. "Come on, come on..."

The scraping stopped.

Silence pressed down. Nothing. No movement, no sound except Donnie's muttering.

Then, from behind the wall beside them: "Mine."

Donnie jumped, nearly dropped his tools. Harold's voice had come from inches away.

"Got it!" Donnie threw the main breaker. Overhead lights buzzed, flickered, came on weakly. Not full power, but enough. The heating system groaned to life somewhere deeper in the basement.

They grabbed their tools and ran for the stairs. Behind them, scraping resumed—footsteps following, then diverging into the passages.

Owen burst into the lobby. "He sabotaged the wiring."

"We know," Angie said grimly, holding the CB radio. Or what was left of it. The case cracked open, circuit boards torn out, antenna cable severed.

Owen's stomach dropped. "When?"

"Two minutes ago. He came while you were downstairs."

Patricia examined the damage. "Beyond repair."

Their only communication with the outside world—gone.

Mark appeared from the hallway, face pale. "There's a fire. Second floor."

Everyone ran for the stairs. The second floor hallway smelled of smoke and kerosene. The linen closet door hung open, charred fabric and blackened walls inside.

Donnie examined the scene. "Deliberately set. Kerosene. Small, controlled. Didn't spread."

"Warning shot," Patricia said.

Harold could have burned the entire wing. But he didn't. This was a message: *I can ignite fires whenever I want.*

"Check your room," Owen told Mark.

They found Mark's equipment in his assigned quarters—destroyed. Film canisters opened, negatives exposed to light and ruined. Cassette tapes unwound, ribbon tangled into useless knots. The Bolex camera smashed against the wall, lens shattered.

Mark picked up a piece of broken camera, hands trembling. "All of it. Every shot I took. Gone."

"He's eliminating our resources," Patricia said, voice clinical despite the fear in her eyes. "Power, communication, documentation. Systematically removing every advantage we have."

Angie paced, agitated. "We need to leave. Now. Break through the snow, hike to town, take our chances with the cold. It's better than waiting here for him to pick us off."

"That's suicide," Owen said. "Temperature's below zero. Forty miles through mountain wilderness. No proper gear. We'd freeze or get lost within hours."

"Better than burning!"

"We don't know he's going to—"

"He set a fire!" Angie's voice cracked. "A warning fire. Next one won't be a warning."

Owen looked at Donnie for support.

"She's not wrong," Donnie admitted. "But she's not right either. Hiking out is a death sentence. Temperature's ten below, maybe worse with wind chill. Forty miles of mountain wilderness. We'd freeze before we made it halfway."

"Better than burning alive!"

"Is it?" Donnie's voice hardened. "I've seen frostbite deaths. Hypothermia. You get confused, disoriented. Start shedding clothes because you think you're hot. Fall asleep in a snowbank and never wake up. At least fire is quick."

Angie stared at him. "You're seriously comparing—"

"I'm saying we have better odds here." Donnie gestured at the lodge around them. "We have shelter, heat, food, water. We know Harold's patterns now. We can defend ourselves."

"Defend ourselves?" Angie's laugh was bitter. "With what? Kitchen knives against a man who's lived like an animal for eight years? Who knows every inch of this building? Who can appear anywhere, strike from anywhere?"

"Then what?" Donnie demanded. "Give up? Walk out into the snow and die?"

"At least we'd be doing something!"

"You'd be committing suicide."

"Stop!" Patricia's voice cut through the argument. She stood between them, notebook in hand. "Fighting each other doesn't help. Let me present the facts."

Everyone turned to her.

Patricia adjusted her glasses. "Weather's improving. The ranger station said five to seven days for road clearing. We're on day five now. That means rescue could arrive as soon as tomorrow morning, or as late as two days from now." She consulted her notes. "Food supplies: if we ration carefully, we have enough for five more days. Water is unlimited—we can melt snow. Firewood is critical—if the heating system fails, we freeze. But Donnie restored partial power, so heating should hold."

"What about Harold?" Mark asked.

"Harold is the variable," Patricia admitted. "But that linen closet fire was deliberately contained. Small, controlled. If he wanted us dead by fire right now, he could have set the whole wing ablaze while we slept. He didn't. Which means he's not ready yet. He's preparing, eliminating our advantages one by one—power, communication, documentation—before the final attack."

"So we have time," Owen said.

"Possibly. If we fortify our position, make it as difficult as possible for Harold to reach us, and defend against his attacks..." Patricia looked at each of them. "Statistically, we can outlast him until rescue arrives."

"Statistically," Angie repeated. "That's a hell of a gamble with our lives."

"It's the best gamble we have." Owen stepped forward. "I'm making the call. We barricade the lobby. Turn it into a fortress. Seal off Harold's access points, protect our supplies, establish defensive positions. Two days maximum until roads are clear. We can hold out two days."

Angie looked at him, anger mixing with fear and something that might have been trust. "And if you're wrong? If Harold burns us before rescue comes?"

Owen met her eyes. "Then we're already dead. But at least we'll have fought."

Silence settled. Everyone processing the decision.

"Then we fight," Donnie said finally.

The words hung in the air. True and terrible.

They began barricading immediately. Donnie grabbed one end of the oak registration desk, Owen the other. The desk was massive—solid oak, built when quality mattered more than cost. Together they dragged it across the lobby floor, wood scraping against carpet, muscles straining.

"Here," Donnie panted. They positioned the desk across the main hallway entrance. It blocked most of the opening, leaving only a narrow gap on one side.

"More," Donnie said. "We need more."

Patricia pulled chairs from the office. Mark, wincing from his bruised ribs, grabbed a filing cabinet. Angie emerged from the dining room dragging a heavy table, face flushed with effort.

They worked with desperate efficiency. Each piece of furniture became part of their fortress—tables stacked on desks, chairs wedged into gaps, cabinets positioned to create barriers.

The lobby entrance facing the main hallway went first. Donnie and Owen built a wall of furniture three feet high, solid enough that Harold couldn't slip through quietly. He'd have to climb over, making noise, giving them warning.

The east hallway entrance next. A tall cabinet, two tables, chairs filled in around the edges. Mark tested it, pushing hard. The barricade held.

"West hallway," Owen said.

They hauled furniture from the staff quarters—bedframes, dressers, a heavy wardrobe that took three of them to move. Positioned everything to create overlapping barriers.

Eleanor watched from her couch by the fire, wrapped in blankets, frostbitten fingers clutched to her chest. Guilt etched deep in the lines of her face.

After an hour of heavy labor, they'd created the basic framework. Three hallway entrances blocked with furniture—solid barriers that would slow any approach.

Owen stood back, breathing hard. His muscles ached. "It's a start."

"We'll need more," Donnie said, wiping sweat from his forehead. "But we're exhausted. Better to rest, finish properly tomorrow when we can think straight."

Patricia was already taking notes. "We'll need to complete a full inventory. Seal the wall panels so he can't surprise us from behind. Organize weapons, establish watch rotations—"

"Tomorrow," Owen interrupted. "We do it right, not fast."

Eleanor watched from the couch, guilt etched on her face. She pulled her blankets tighter.

The group gathered supplies scattered around the lobby—blankets, water, the remaining food they'd grabbed hastily. Made themselves as comfortable as possible.

Outside, through the snow-covered windows, darkness had fallen. The storm had broken. Stars were visible for the first time in days.

"Weather's clearing," Donnie observed. "Roads will be plowed soon."

"If we survive that long," Angie muttered.

Owen looked at the dark hallway entrances beyond their partial barricades. Somewhere in those shadows, in the passages behind the walls, Harold waited.

Watching them work.

Planning his next move.

Preparing his fire.

They settled in for the night, exhausted but unable to truly rest. Every sound might be Harold. Every creak might signal attack.

Tomorrow they'd finish fortifying.

Tonight, they just had to survive.
