# Chapter 4: Room 9

The second day trapped dawned gray and cold.

Owen woke to wind battering the building. 7:15 AM. The storm hadn't let up. Through his window, all he could see was white—snow pressed against glass.

He found Patricia in the kitchen making coffee on the camping stove.

"Morning," she said. "Sleep okay?"

"Not really." Owen accepted the cup. "You?"

"The building makes too much noise. Every creak sounds like something breaking."

They drank in silence. Wind screamed outside. In the walls, pipes groaned.

"I want to check the east wing," Owen said. "Make sure no windows failed overnight."

"Sure." Patricia finished her coffee. "Let me get my clipboard."

They grabbed flashlights and headed upstairs. The second floor was colder than the first—heat rose, and they'd shut down heating to unused sections to conserve fuel. Their breath formed clouds in the dim hallway.

Owen checked Rooms 10 through 14. All secure. Windows intact, no leaks, doors locked. Patricia made notes, her pencil scratching in the quiet.

They moved down the hallway toward the east wing's end.

Patricia stopped. "Door 9 is closed."

Owen looked up. She was right. Room 9's door was shut while every other door in the hallway stood open—they'd left them that way during winterization for air circulation.

"I don't remember closing it," Owen said.

"Neither do I." Patricia consulted her notes. "And the key went missing yesterday."

Owen tried the handle. Locked.

He pulled out his master key ring, found the override key that opened any guest room. Slid it into the lock. The mechanism clicked.

He pushed the door open.

Inside, lying on the bed fully clothed, was an elderly woman.

Owen's breath stopped.

She lay on top of the bare mattress, wearing a heavy coat and dress, shoes still on her feet. Her hands rested at her sides, fingers blackened with frostbite. Her face was pale, almost blue, skin papery and thin. Eyes closed. Not moving.

"Oh God," Patricia whispered.

Owen crossed the room in three steps, pressed his fingers to the woman's neck. Skin ice-cold. He waited, barely breathing.

There—pulse. Weak, thready, but present.

"She's alive," he said. "Hypothermia. We need to warm her. Now."

Patricia stood frozen in the doorway.

"Patricia!" Owen's voice cracked like a whip. "Help me!"

She snapped out of it, moved to the bedside. Together they lifted the woman—she was light, disturbingly light, like lifting a bundle of sticks wrapped in cloth. Owen took her shoulders, Patricia her legs.

They carried her out of Room 9, down the hallway, toward the stairs.

"What's happening?" Mark appeared on the landing, camera in hand out of habit. His eyes went wide when he saw them. "Is she—"

"Get Angie," Owen ordered. "Blankets, hot water, anything warm. Lobby fireplace. Move!"

Mark ran.

They descended carefully, the woman's head lolling against Owen's chest. Her breathing was shallow, barely perceptible. How long had she been in that room? Hours? Days?

And how the hell did she get there?

In the lobby, Donnie was building up the fire. "What's going on?"

"Found her in Room 9," Owen said. "Severe hypothermia."

Donnie's eyes narrowed. "Room 9. That's impossible. We checked every room. Lodge was empty."

"Well, she's here now. Help me."

They laid the woman on the couch nearest the fireplace. Donnie threw more wood on the fire, flames crackling higher. Heat washed over Owen's face.

Angie arrived with blankets, Patricia with a thermos of hot water. Mark hovered with his camera, filming but keeping back.

"Gradual warming," Donnie said, kneeling beside the couch. "Too fast and it'll shock her system. Layer the blankets. Get the fire hot but not too close."

They worked together. Owen removed the woman's shoes—her toes were frostbitten, black and swollen. Angie layered blankets over her, tucking them tight. Patricia wetted a cloth with warm water, dabbed it on the woman's lips.

"Who is she?" Angie asked.

"I have no idea," Owen said.

"How did she get in Room 9?"

"I don't know."

"Was the door locked?"

"Yes."

Angie stared at him. "Owen. How did she get in a locked room?"

He had no answer.

Patricia stood, clipboard forgotten. "I'm checking the registry."

She returned five minutes later, shaking her head. "No entry. Last guest checked out October 15th. Nothing since then."

"She had to come from somewhere," Donnie said. "Did you check the window?"

Owen's stomach dropped. "No. I'll check now."

He climbed back to the second floor, returned to Room 9. The window was intact, locked from the inside. He examined the frame—no damage, no forced entry. Outside the window, snow was packed tight against the glass. No footprints, no disturbed snow, nothing to indicate someone had climbed through.

He checked the door lock. No scratches, no signs of picking. The room showed no signs of break-in.

Owen stood in the center of Room 9 and turned slowly. This room looked like every other guest room. Same furniture, same layout, same yellowed curtains. Nothing special. Nothing strange.

Except an unconscious woman had been locked inside, and there was no way she could have gotten in.

He returned to the lobby.

"Window's locked from inside," he reported. "No signs of entry. Snow outside is undisturbed."

"That's impossible," Angie said. "She didn't just appear."

"I know."

"Then how—"

"I don't know!" Owen's voice rose. He caught himself, breathed. "I don't know. But she's here. She's real. We need to focus on keeping her alive."

The woman stirred. Her eyelids fluttered.

Everyone fell silent, watching.

Her eyes opened—pale blue, unfocused. She stared at the ceiling, breath hitching.

"Ma'am?" Patricia leaned closer. "Can you hear me?"

The woman's eyes darted, searching faces. Her lips moved, but no sound came out.

"You're safe," Patricia said gently. "You're in Timberline Lodge. We're going to help you."

The woman tried to speak. Her voice came out as a rasp, barely audible. "Cold..."

"I know. We're warming you. Just rest."

"He... he's still..." The woman's breathing quickened, panic rising in her eyes. "He's still here..."

Owen leaned in. "Who's still here?"

"He never left..." Her hand shot out, grabbed Owen's wrist with surprising strength. Her blackened fingers dug into his skin. "He's in the walls... watching... always watching..."

"Who?" Owen asked urgently. "Who's watching?"

The woman's eyes locked on his, wide with terror.

"Harold," she whispered. "Harold... he never died..."

Owen's blood went cold. "What did you say?"

But the woman's eyes rolled back. She slumped against the cushions, unconscious again.

Owen stared at her, his wrist still throbbing where she'd grabbed him.

Harold.

His uncle's name. His father's brother. The man who'd disappeared in 1972, presumed dead in the mountains.

"Owen?" Patricia touched his arm. "What is it?"

He pulled his arm back, still staring at the unconscious woman. "She said Harold."

"Who's Harold?"

"My uncle." Owen's voice sounded distant to his own ears. "He built this lodge with my father. He disappeared eight years ago. Everyone thought he was dead."

"Maybe she knew him," Mark suggested. "Before he disappeared."

"Maybe." But the woman had said *he's still here*. Present tense. As if Harold was alive. As if he was in the building.

Donnie stood, walked to the windows, looked out at the white wall of snow. "How old is she? Seventy?"

"About that," Angie confirmed.

"And she's been in this lodge, in that room, for how long?" Donnie turned to face them. "She should be dead. Hypothermia this severe, no food, no water—days at minimum. Maybe longer."

"Someone put her there," Patricia said quietly. "Recently. Within the last 24 hours, or she wouldn't have survived."

"Who?" Angie demanded. "We're the only ones here."

Silence.

The wind screamed outside. The fire crackled. In the walls, pipes groaned and settled.

"We need to search the building," Owen said. "Top to bottom. Every room, every closet. If someone else is here—"

"That's crazy," Angie interrupted. "We checked every room during winterization. We've been here two days. We would have seen someone."

"Then how do you explain her?" Owen gestured at the unconscious woman.

Angie had no answer.

"We search," Owen said firmly. "Pairs. Armed with flashlights and tools. We check every damn room until we know for certain we're alone."

"And if we're not?" Mark asked.

Owen picked up the fireplace poker, tested its weight. "Then we deal with it."

---

They split into pairs. Owen and Patricia took the east wing. Donnie and Mark the west wing. Angie stayed with the woman, armed with the largest kitchen knife, guarding the lobby.

Owen and Patricia moved through the second floor methodically. Each room the same: unlock door, sweep flashlight across empty space, check windows and closets, lock door behind them. Room after room after room.

All empty.

They climbed to the third floor. More of the same. Empty rooms, dust, silence.

In Room 34—where Donnie's wrench had gone missing—Owen paused. He swept his flashlight slowly across the walls, the ceiling, the floor.

"What are you looking for?" Patricia asked.

"I don't know." But something felt wrong. He could feel it in his gut, the same feeling he'd had during winterization. The sense of being watched.

He checked the closet. Empty except for wire hangers.

They moved on.

Donnie and Mark reported back in the lobby an hour later: west wing clear. No signs of occupation, no hidden occupants, nothing out of place.

"Maybe we missed something during winterization," Donnie admitted. "Maybe she was hiding, and we didn't see her."

"For two days?" Patricia shook her head. "Without food, without heat? She'd be dead."

"Then I don't know what to tell you." Donnie lit a cigarette, hands shaking slightly. "This doesn't make sense."

The woman slept on the couch, color slowly returning to her face. Her breathing was stronger now, more regular. She'd survive. Probably.

But the questions remained.

Who was she?

How did she get into a locked room?

And why had she spoken Harold's name?

Owen stood at the lobby windows, staring at the snow pressing against the glass. Behind him, the group talked in low voices, debating theories that didn't fit the evidence.

He thought about his uncle. Harold Reeves, brilliant and unstable, who'd helped design this building down to the last detail. Who'd fought his family for years over ownership. Who'd disappeared during a winter storm in 1972 and never been found.

Everyone assumed he'd walked into the mountains and frozen to death.

But what if he hadn't?

What if Harold had never left?

Owen turned from the window, looked at the woman on the couch.

"Who are you?" he whispered.

But she didn't answer. She just slept, surrounded by strangers, in a building that should have been empty.

And somewhere in the walls—in the spaces between floors, behind panels, in the hidden crawlspaces only the builder would know—something listened.

And smiled.
