# Chapter 13: Eleanor's Testimony

Night. Eleanor was strong enough now to tell her full story.

They gathered around her in the lobby—Owen, Patricia, Angie, Donnie, Mark with his notebook ready to document everything. The fire crackled. Outside, the storm had finally broken. Stars were visible for the first time in days.

Tomorrow rescue would begin. But first, they needed to understand Harold completely.

"Start from the beginning," Owen said gently. "The first letter."

Eleanor took a breath, gathering memories that were painful to revisit.

"May fifteenth, 1980. Six months ago. I was living in Phoenix—retired, quiet life. My brother Harold had been dead for eight years. Or so I thought."

She paused, hands trembling slightly. Patricia offered water. Eleanor drank, continued.

"The letter arrived with no return address. Just a postmark from this town in Colorado. Inside was a single page, handwritten. I recognized Harold's handwriting immediately—distinctive, precise, the way engineers write. But it couldn't be Harold. Harold was dead."

"What did it say?" Patricia asked, pen poised over her notebook.

"'Dear Eleanor, They told you I died. They were wrong. I'm alive. I've been here all along, in the place they stole from me. I have proof—documents showing what James did, how he forged the competency hearing, how he stole my creation. I need you to witness the truth. Please come. Your brother, Harold.'"

Eleanor's voice broke on the last words. Angie handed her a tissue.

"I thought it was a cruel prank," Eleanor continued. "Someone who knew family history, trying to hurt me. I almost threw it away. But something made me keep it."

"The handwriting?" Owen suggested.

"And the tone. It sounded like Harold—the Harold from before he got sick. Formal, precise, hurt. I wrote back to the return address, asking for proof."

"And he sent more letters," Patricia said, making notes.

"Three more over the summer. Each one more detailed, more desperate. He described our childhood—things only Harold would remember. Our mother's favorite song. The treehouse our father built. The day our dog died and Harold cried for hours. Private family moments no stranger could know."

Eleanor pulled folded papers from her pocket—the surviving letters, worn from repeated reading.

"In the third letter, he sent photographs. Polaroids of himself holding newspapers dated May, June, July 1980. Proof he was alive. And photos taken inside Timberline—our father's office chair, the window where our mother used to watch snow fall. Locations only family would recognize as significant."

She handed the photos to Owen. He studied them—Harold gaunt and wild, but unmistakably alive, unmistakably here.

"The final letter came in late October," Eleanor said. "That's when he asked me to come. Said the lodge was being sold, his creation would be destroyed, and he needed me to witness his 'final act.' Said I was the only family member who'd ever tried to defend him during the competency hearing."

"Did you?" Angie asked.

"I did. I thought Harold was sick, needed help, not punishment. But I was overruled. The family closed ranks, declared him incompetent, took his share of the business. I always felt guilty about not fighting harder."

"So you came," Owen said.

"I arrived November 10th. Three days before you did. Stayed at the Pine View motel, twelve miles down. Harold called me at midnight. His voice—I recognized it immediately. Rough, but lucid. He gave me instructions: come to the lodge the next night at midnight. The basement window on the east side would be unlocked. Enter there, go to Room 9, wait. Tell no one."

"And you went," Owen said.

"He was my brother. I drove up at 11:45 PM, parked where he specified. The building was completely dark. I found the basement window, crawled through. The basement was terrifying—pitch black, machinery groaning. I found the stairs, went up to Room 9. Waited."

Eleanor's hands trembled.

"Twenty minutes later, the door opened. Harold stood there, backlit by moonlight. Tall, thin, wild hair. He said my name. Then stepped inside."

She paused.

"Seeing him clearly was a shock. Skeletal, filthy, hair white and matted. But his eyes were bright, intelligent. He knew exactly what he was doing."

"What did he say?" Patricia asked.

"'Eleanor. You came. You were always the good one.' He sat beside me, calm. Pulled out papers—architectural drawings, journals, photographs. Showed me everything. The hidden passages. The sabotage. Every fire, every accident from 1960 to 1980. He was proud of it."

"He showed you evidence of his crimes," Owen said.

"He called it justice. Showed me journals—dated entries, detailed descriptions. Explained how he'd been living in the walls since 1972. Eight years. Called it his greatest achievement—protecting her from the unworthy. Always called the lodge 'her.'"

"Then he told you about the cleansing," Owen prompted.

Everyone leaned forward.

"Harold said the lodge was being sold to developers who'd tear her down—he always called the building 'her'—and that was unacceptable. If he couldn't have her, if the family insisted on destroying her, then everyone would burn together."

Eleanor's voice dropped to barely a whisper.

"He pulled out more papers—floor plans marked with red X's showing where he'd place fires. Six locations: kitchen, basement boiler room, second floor east and west wings, third floor storage, and the main lobby entrance. Said he'd light them simultaneously using kerosene and fuses. Create a ring of fire trapping anyone inside. 'Return the lodge to her pure state through cleansing fire,' he said. 'She and I will ascend together, purified.'"

Mark stopped writing. "He planned to die in the fire himself?"

"Yes. He sees it as transcendence, not death. Becoming one with the building he loves." Eleanor wiped tears. "That's when I understood how far gone he was. This wasn't about revenge anymore. It was about love—twisted, delusional love for a building he believes is alive."

"What did you do?" Angie asked.

"I tried to reason with him. Told him he needed help, that I'd get him doctors, lawyers, whatever he needed. He laughed—this horrible, broken laugh. Said I'd betrayed him just like the rest. That I'd come here to trick him, to take him away from his home. I stood up to leave. He grabbed me, pushed me back onto the bed. Stronger than he looked."

Eleanor touched her bruised arm, still marked from Harold's grip.

"He took my coat, my car keys, my purse with ID. Locked me in Room 9. Said I'd stay there until the cleansing. That I needed to witness his justice, needed to tell the world the truth about the Reeves family after I was the only survivor."

"He planned to leave you alive?" Patricia asked.

"As witness. He'd set the fires, I'd escape—he told me exactly how, which window to break, which route through the snow. Then I'd tell authorities what the family had done to drive him to this. His final revenge: making me testify to his righteousness."

The calculation was chilling. Harold had planned everything, including his martyrdom and Eleanor's survival to spread his narrative.

"How long were you locked in there?" Angie asked.

"Days. Maybe three, maybe four. Hard to track time when you're freezing and starving. No food. Water from the bathroom tap—I had to drink from cupped hands. The room was freezing—he'd turned off heat to that wing deliberately. Part of my punishment for 'betraying' him."

Eleanor shuddered at the memory.

"I could hear him sometimes. Moving in the walls, talking to himself—or to the building. Long rambling conversations about justice, about purification, about 'her voice.' I screamed for help but there was no one. I thought I'd die there."

"Until we found you," Owen said.

"Until you arrived. And Harold's plan changed." Eleanor looked at each of them. "He wanted you here. When he heard your vehicles, heard the family had returned, he put me where you'd find me. Evidence of his commitment. Proof he'd do anything. And witnesses—he needed the family itself to witness his final act."

Patricia had filled several pages with notes. "Did he mention specific timing for the fires?"

"He said 'when the storm breaks and they think rescue is near.' He wanted to maximize despair—let you believe you'd survived the storm, that help was coming. Then take it all away with fire. Psychological torture before the physical."

"That's tomorrow," Donnie said grimly. "Storm's over. Weather's clearing. Roads will be plowed within days. That's Harold's trigger."

Owen stood, paced. "You said he wanted you to survive as witness. Why?"

"To tell the world what the Reeves family did to him. To validate his revenge. Harold doesn't just want to kill us—he wants history to judge us as villains. He wants newspapers to print his story. He wants people to understand he was driven to this, that he's the victim." Eleanor met Owen's eyes. "He wants the last word. And he's planned it so carefully that even in death, he wins."

Silence settled.

"We won't let him have it," Owen said finally. "Tomorrow we stop Harold. End this before he can light his fires."

"How?" Angie asked.

"We hunt him. Force him into confrontation on our terms, not his. He's spent forty years hiding in walls. Tomorrow we drag him into the light."

Patricia closed her notebook. Mark stopped recording. Donnie stubbed out his cigarette.

They had Eleanor's testimony. Harold's plan was confirmed. The timeline was set.

Tomorrow would bring the confrontation.

Tonight, they prepared for war.

In the walls, Harold listened to Eleanor's betrayal, heard her expose his plans, his timeline, his truth.

And smiled.

Let them know. Let them prepare.

It wouldn't matter.

The fire was coming.

And nothing would stop it.
